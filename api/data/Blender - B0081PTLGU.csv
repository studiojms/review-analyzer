04/23/2023,United States,4,Serena,If you like lid wrestling.,"I had to replace by very old blender and I wanted a nice one. It really is nice until you try to use it.As a senior citizen, I can barely, with lots of effort, get the lid off the top. For that reason, the potential pleasure of using it, is diminished. The amount of effort is not worth having it. I would not buy it again just for that reason. Otherwise I would be lovin' it!The design of the lid is also a problem. I like to make frozen drinks and smoothies. But the 2 spouts on the top are near useless. The actual openings is too far from the edge so what you are pouring makes a mess because how far it has to go to get out of the blender and into the glass you want to put into. So I have to take the top off to pour directly from the blender.I will just deal with it.

I use it like a cover and hold it down with my hand.It’s very easy to clean, I don’t even use soap.My old Hamilton blend’s glass beaker fits perfectly- so now I have a spare!CON:1) The old one used to stop swirling for a second so everything could fall back down to the blades. I can mimic that by holding the pulses halfway down and then releasing the buttons- so it pulses full time, stops when I release button, then resumes full time when I press it down again halfway.But I can’t do that on any of the other buttons like mix or smoothie.3) salsa is a lie!

I was getting the food ready for my baby’s 1st birthday. I tried to mix berries, and I had to stop it frequently and mix with a spoon to “help” the blender to crush the fruits (they were not frozen and still was struggling!!!). Then I tried to blend oats so I could make oat flour, and OMG, I had to stop thousand times and still didn’t get the oats 100% blended. I had to do little by little to be able to get some flour. The only thing that was mixed “better” but incredibly took longer than the other cheaper blenders I’ve had was the eggs with oil and milk. Can you imagine? Struggling this much with a blender.

I own a small expresso shop, and have had the same blender for nearly 12 years. My old blender began chewing through coupler teeth over the past year, so I looked for a newer model.This Hamilton Beach blender has a wide base into which the pitcher fits snugly, thus reducing the chance of stripping the couplers.It makes frappes which are beautifully smooth and tasty. And IT IS HELLA QUIET! The glass pitcher makes it much quieter than my previous plastic blender.Just a note: I tried to order a second pitcher at the same time, but this model is too new for Amazon to have them.

It did well with the berries and even the frozen banana but failed with nuts.One of my favorite smoothies is banana and blueberry. I add a handful of almonds to get some protein. The blueberries were fresh, the banana was frozen. It mixed them okay, but there were still noticeable large chunks of almonds in the mix, even after blending for a couple minutes. Chunks were 1/8 to 1/4 inch.My old blender was a Hamilton Beach and it lasted 25 years so I bought another by the same company. Old blender mixed nuts just fine down to micro particles. Noticed a design differences between the two. Old one had a narrower base. Blades almost touched the sides. New one had a wider base and the mixing blades were about 1/2 inch from the sides. This allowed the nuts to be pulled down to the blades but not actually get cut by the blades.Overall disappointed but the blender is still functional.

This one is the perfect size for me to lift (older woman, some arthritis in hands), and the size is sufficient for our two-person household. Ground up my ice-based smoothie perfectly today. Followed the instructions carefully - adding the liquid first and then the ice cubes. I think I did that wrong with my old blender, which hastened its demise.This blender is also very easy to clean. There was a complaint from another purchaser about the top being too difficult for his wife to remove so I was a little worried about that, and the top does fit very tightly, but I figured out how to ease it off without too much discomfort.If you're looking to spend around $40-50 for a blender this is a very nice one.I read",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3C5HFVGLK555I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,43,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

My old one had many years of use but the plastic on this new model appears too fragile to stand up to average use. My assessment was accurate when I was unable to disengage the blender jar from the so-called collar.

It finally loosened after running it under very hot water. This is not what I call ease of use.

This lid design is so bad that it makes my eyelid twitch.The first issue is that it's so ridiculously tight that it takes serious work to wedge it on and ALL my muscle to get it back off. I've had more than a few nervous moments where I thought I wasn't going to be able to pull it off.And, for all that, IT DOESN'T SEAL worth crap. If I really get the ingredients flying around I can watch with bemusement as the fluid slowly slips between the edge of the lid and the glass and works its way right out. That has become a kind of ironic way to time the blend for me. Right before the fluid begins to spray all over my cabinets, it's done.Of course it's not quite done because I still have lumps, but it is what it is. Times up.There's a stupid little flap that's cut out of the lid's plastic itself. I think it's supposed to be used to drop things in while the blender is running, but it's too small to even get an ice cube through in one piece. It might latch. It might not. Depends on the mood of the gods that day.I get the impression that the lid was designed by the engineer to be made of a softer plastic and some managerial genius decided they would save money by making it out of a cheaper, harder material.The pour spout is the only part of the lid that's not terrible, but with the crappy seal, when I try to use the spout, fluid is dripping from the base of the lid and making a mess anyway. This makes the spout completely meaningless.This lid is so awful that I don't think I can make this blender work long term. I've tried to be alright with it and I've kept it too long to return, but I think I'm going to give this away to someone I hate and get a new one.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1T526NOIQ2D4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,5,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

I will never buy another Hamilton Beach blender again and probably will avoid their other products since I assume the warranty practice requiring customers to pay to ship both ways is probably the same.",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D63ZTFGSD3DZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,1,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

06/30/2022,United States,2,Jennifer,Frustrating Blender,"Unfortunately, this blender is a royal pain in every way. The first flaw is that the lid is very flexible and cheap plastic. For some reason, it fits too tightly on the top of the blender and it is basically impossible to get off. I broke a finger nail trying to get it off. I found if I run the glass portion with the top under hot water then it comes off easier. But, then the glass container is slippery and water can get in to what you are mixing. It also makes it dangerous removing the lid because you don't want to put too much pressure on the glass. I have never had an issue like this with any other blender. The other problem I had was at one point the glass was so tightly attached to the base that I had to rotate the blender to remove it which unscrewed the base and the blade causing the contents to leak out. Very disappointing. Finally, the cord is really short which makes it hard to use. This blender is not made well and is not worth the money.

03/02/2022,United States,2,Terry J.,Disappointing,"We got this for basic smoothie blending. I like that it’s a glass jar. Otherwise, I’m not a fan. There’s a little rubber flap in addition to the pouring spout that can be opened on the lid. I guess it’s to allow for more ways to add things in between blending, but it’s very cheaply made. The flap doesn’t stay closed, it pops open on its own randomly. The description says it continuously pulls mixture down into blades, but it doesn’t consistently. Once the lid is on, it's hard to take off to stir or scrape the sides, which I have to do a lot. The blending power is okay.

12/18/2021,United States,4,Chip C,"Good value, works fine. Plastic lid could be better","I've had this blender about six weeks and use it mostly for smoothies or cocktails. It has worked flawlessly and does exactly what I want. In particular, it provides excellent mixing throughout the glass jar, with no dead spots that I've seen. The glass jar is easy to clean. I took off one star because of two concerns. 1) the plastic lid takes some effort to put on properly, and takes more effort to pull off. Some users might not be able to put it on all the way or, having done so, may struggle taking it off. And I wonder how long the plastic will last. 2) depending on how the blades are rotated, the jar may not fully engage with the base.

08/22/2021,United States,4,JD,"They do not make them like they used to, but then nobody does","This blender was going to have a tough time measuring up, since it was replacing one that cost twice as much and had lasted for nearly 20 years - and even then it was the jar that cracked. On the positive side, the wide base of the jar and the multiple settings mean that it blends anything without clogging and to different consistencies. The shape of the jar also makes it very easy to clean, which I do by hand rather than running it through a dishwasher. On the negative side, one of the reasons it blends so well and does not clog is that it throws contents all over the jar and lid, no matter what is being blended and no matter what setting. Having to use a rubber spatula to recover contents, and the extra cleaning involved, are not major problems, but for me they are the difference between a four star and a five star review.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUOM3BXK7P1ZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,4,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

With the amount of liquid you need to add to get this to even remotely work you can only make smoothies. Also, it just doesn't seem to be able to handle large amounts of frozen fruit.

On the second day, I put only half and the 3rd day only one at a time. Each try I had to take the lid off several times and use a spatula to push the fruit down towards the blades. It became a chore.

12/05/2020,United States,1,Pumpkin,Crushes ice and mix smoothies as well as a toy blender,"I bought this to replace an old glass Oster blender since it was on sale and had so many great reviews and resembled the glass Oster. Then when I read the low reviews, I see others had the same problems. We make a lot of smoothies and this one says it is great for crushing ice. This thing does not work well and the smoothie ingredients did not get sucked down into the blade and blend like a blender is supposed to do..We attempted 4 smoothies in it. I put the ice in first, as shown on the blender box picture, and would have to use a long spoon to move ingredients around to get the thing to even blend. Then I tried putting the bananas/fruit/yogurt in first and the ice (switched to crushed ice even) in last..same problem with it not blending and yogurt was stuck to the glass sides. I don’t know if I got a defective one or what but it is junk. Another issue is the base is made of cheap thin hard plastic as is the lid, unlike my old blender which has a heavy duty flexible plastic lid and a hard plastic base. The lid on this thing was impossible to pry off after making a smoothie that I broke a nail.. also the lid flew across the counter and spewed smoothie mess everywhere. So we went back to using our 20 yr old Oster blender and just bought a new new steel blade for it as it has a metal gear that then goes into the metal blender base.. which tears ice to shreds and blends smoothies. This thing does not have a metal gear assembly but instead has a cheap plastic gear assembly that goes into the hard cheap plastic base.. not made to last.My 13 yr old smoothie queen rolled her eyes and said why did you buy the cheap one..

08/19/2020,United States,4,Ag,"4 years later review... smoothies, purees, oats, hummus...","I was randomly scrolling through my old Amazon purchases and realized how long ago I had bought this blender. I've been using it pretty much every single day and I had blended various types of foods in it.Smoothies: Great. it easily cuts any frozen fruit.Ice: Meh. I've always had trouble using it to crush ice. Honestly, I don't think the blade is sharp/big enough to do it, or at least I never could crush a lot of ice. I personally don't really have a need for rushed ice and I get my icy consistency from frozen fruit anyways.Hummus: Great. it works perfectly fine chopping cooked chickpeas (with a little bit of liquid obviously).Oat milk: Great. It chops the oats well.Soup puree: Perfect! I often puree my soups in it and it makes them extra light, fluffy, and thick.Spinach (fresh leaves) puree: Great. I was making spinach roll-ups and needed spinach mixture. Note that I had to add quite a bit of water, but it did chop fresh spinach leaves completely into a smooth puree.Tomato puree aka pizza sauce: Great. It just works.Pesto: Not so good. I know it's not a food processor, but sometimes these blenders can be used for some easy food processor jobs, too. Unlike spinach puree mentioned above, I couldn't add too much liquid into basil leaves. As a result, the blender did not chop the leaves, even though I kept adding more oil, lemon juice, and even greek yogurt. Finally, once it had enough liquid in it, it pureed the basil, but it dd not resemble pesto. For that, you'll need to make your pesto in a food processor or by hand.As far as cleaning goes, it's super easy. Personally I don't like cleaning it, but that's just because you have to take it apart (obviously) and I'm too lazy for that.The power settings on it do not vary that much. For a long time I couldn't really notice a difference between them. Obviously lowest is slow and highest is fast, but I found the labels under each button not useful at all. I mean, it's just a motor, so after a while, I just use whatever setting I feel like is appropriate for the job and often switch between them to make sure everything is blended well.As for the liquid leaking that people mention on here, I personally have never had any leakage UNLESS I didn't properly align the rubber gasket on the bottom of the blender, which is easy to do, but I remember one or two times when I missed.Overall, I think it's a great blender for smoothies and purees and I'd recommend it to anyone.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVY1T3Q4AVV4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,5,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

I’m thinking if I should blend it with hot water to soften up the greens, but then I might as well cook them. With fruits it’s pretty nifty, no complaints. Fresh fruits with ice come out great.

01/05/2020,United States,5,E. A. Jacques,Nice Blender with Plenty of Power - Easy to Clean,"I recently decided to try a vegetarian diet so it was a given I would need a blender to mix up some protein based drinks. I am not sure I will be staying a vegetarian so I did not want to spend $50 or more for a blender since I never needed one before now. Seems like the big factor is whether or not a blender can chop ice. Well this is not a factor for me since I have issues with brain freeze when just taking even a small sip of any slushy type drinks. That made it easier in my mind to go with a less expensive model. Based on the power it seems to have, I suspect it would chop ice just fine, but have not tried it and probably never will.That said, it has real good power and mixes up pretty much anything I put in it with no problem. So far that has been fresh fruit, veggies, soy based milks and various powders - nothing very challenging I suppose. I wanted a blender with a glass jar and this one has a very heavy thick glass jar with a very snug fitting top. I really like the flip open spout on the top too - it's very convenient. I usually mix a blender full of whatever, pour a glass...then put the jar in the fridge to store what is left. The 40 oz size is perfect for my needs and I like that it's shorter and more compact looking.I hand wash my dishes so to clean it I fill it with soapy water, put the top on and shake it to loosen up what is stuck to the sides. I finish the job with a long handled cleaning brush I have and I'm good to go. Doesn't take more than a couple of minutes to get it real clean - which is one reason I wanted a model with a glass jar. I have had plastic blenders in the past and the are just not as easy to clean and eventually get scratched and opaque looking, especially if you put them in a dishwasher. It's not super quiet I guess. I imagine higher end models might be quieter, but that is not a factor for me...hey it's a blender and they make noise. End of story.The only negative I would point out are the buttons on the front are a little cheap feeling so not sure how well they will hold up over time. I suppose that is expected for a blender at this price point. But IMO the heavy glass jar and super tight fitting top are more important features. Plus I could buy two or three of these blenders for the price of one of the higher end models. I only use it once or twice a week so it will probably last me a long time.Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and can recommend this blender for anyone who has similar needs and usage requirements.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37AD2EWCLLJN5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,17,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

11/02/2019,United States,2,Brad Roth,"14 Function"" is a Marketing Scam--- Also lacks sufficient power to puree""","I just purchased this blender to replace my Hamilton Beach Scovill model 564 14-SPEED blender that I purchased in the 80's and finally the blade housing unit cracked and the bushing started deteriorating and it now leaks. I have been very happy with the blender so I purchased another Hamilton Beach blender, model 54221.Boy, what a disappointment! Even though this blender (700 WATTS) is TWICE the wattage of the Scovill model 564 (330 WATTS) it has FAR LESS power. I mainly use the blender to make green smoothies consisting of fresh spinach and kale with frozen fruit mixed in. This blender on the highest speed took 3-4 minutes to puree the greens, and even after that long, the fruit was still in chunks.And this blender is advertised as 14 functions which I interpreted to mean 14-speed like my Scovill but it only has SIX speeds... how are they getting 14 functions out of this? Are they trying to say that because each speed button is labeled with two different uses plus the two pulse buttons, they are claiming 14 functions? What a marketing SCAM. Yeah you can buy a volleyball and kick it around like a soccer ball, but that doesn't make it a volleyball and a soccer ball.I can now see from the blades on this blender why it doesn't work as good: my Scovill blender has two sets of perpendicular blades, and this blender has two sets of parallel blades fixed on top of each other.If I can't buy a better blade from Hamilton Beach, then I am going to return this. It's FAR inferior to my 30+ year old Scovill.

08/18/2019,United States,3,Tyler Bartnick,"Affordable blender, but lacking","The blender itself is nice. I've used it almost daily since buying it, but I have noticed some drawbacks. If you just need a blender to blend smoothies and margaritas, this will definitely work. However, the drawbacks are kind of a big deal to me so I don't think I would recommend this particular model to anyone. First, all the parts that move together like gears in order to actually blend something are plastic. At first, I didn't think it would be a problem, but after the first couple of uses, you can see that the gear teeth are visibly eroding away from friction - obviously not ideal for a long term solution. Additionally, the teeth tend to leave behind a fine plastic sand all over the base of the blender as they wear away. That is probably the most annoying thing to me about this blender. They don't get in your food or drink or anything like that, but you have to clean it after every use once the teeth start to wear down. Second, the power output isn't anything special. I've had a few times already where a recipe I was following suggested I use a blender to make a puree. This blender will not be a good fit for that type of use.If you just need a basic blender, this will suffice. However, you probably shouldn't expect much else out of it.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QJ34WL8FSQOV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,2,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

This is the only adjustment I have had to make. For the price, the blender is actually a much better value than I expected. I rinse it under running water immediately. This makes cleaning it a breeze since the pitcher section comes completely apart. I like the pour spouts in the lid. I am pleased with this product.

12/03/2018,United States,1,EsperanzaSN,"I never say this, but really - do not buy!","I was looking for a heavy duty blender for smoothies, particularly to crush ice quickly. This seemed a good choice but wow am I ever disappointed. Here are the reasons:1. The mixer I feel has a design flaw. The picture has deep indentions, sort of a fluted effect, at the base. This means that all of your smoothie ingredients in. Pushed into those indentions and are completely missed by the blades.2. The blades themselves are set one on top of the other. Again this appears to be a design flaw. They should be offset so that each set is hitting your blendable ingredients differently. I thought perhaps this was something that had happened in transit and tried to correct but they are locked tight one on the other with both blade sets pointing in the same direction.All in all, a waste of money. I've tried 2 different smoothies. I tried using it to crush Ritz crackers. I even tried using it to cut up mushrooms. No matter what I put into it, all the ingredients end up pushed into those large indentions and nothing gets mixed or cut. Even fresh banana stayed whole.

It is also relatively difficult to clean. Unless there is a large amount of material, the blades simply fling all of the material to the side and nothing happens. You have to push the material back down over and over. As it starts to chop it, then you can shake the blender while it is running. I have an Oster that is otherwise very similar except that it does a great job with small batches. That is because the lower pair of blades are much lower and the material cannot escape by sitting below the blades, and that material forces the stuff that would sit on the sides to keep moving.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7OHPLPD5BDOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,1,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

Excellent blender, best ever for the price which was under $35. The little plastic ring broke that holds the blades to the glass. It's a nothing little piece of plastic, the least sophisticated part on the blender. Even though it's under warranty (6 months old) Hamilton Beach wants $5.99 to ship it to me. I wanted to get an extra since this obviously is a part that will fail repeatedly. They offered an extra for $5.99 + another additional $5.99 shipping. That's almost half the cost of the ENTIRE BLENDER. For a small plastic ring. Listen, I like the blender, but the warranty policy is a rip off, and the idea that you pay double the price for slow (10 day) shipping on a piece of plastic is just stupid. I even offered to buy an extra, just put it in the same shipment, NOPE, they want double the price of the part for shipping for each piece.

And none of them came with this terrible spout. Secondly, if your pulsing with the pitcher over half full, the contents will shoot up to the closed spout, and drip out the sides. The spout is super annoying to clean by hand as well.Besides the lid I'd say it's a decent blender, especially for under $40.

I really went back and forth doing research for a good blender and I was torn between this one and the Ninja. However from the reviews you can see that the Ninja can be dangerous and knowing how clumsy I am that stopped me from buying it. Also I watched video reviews of the ninja and it seems like it didn't blend well enough, however, this blender blends AMAZINGLY. I chose this one because it seemed like the best choice as far as consistency goes and the price is wonderful so if it stops working in a year or two years (I make smoothies on a daily basis) then it's priced well enough that I could just replace it with a new one every year or 2. This blender's settings are great, it has no trouble blending frozen fruits or ice and my smoothies taste amazing. It blends my protein powder well so it doesnt get stuck on the sides and doesn't clump up in my smoothie.

Nope. It took over 5 minutes to make a smoothie with frozen fruit, and there was nothing smooth about; it was super chunky. The same thing happened when I added a can of chickpeas with water, olive oil and tahini. It took over 20 minutes with repeated stirring to move the heavier pieces toward the blade and many pauses so as to not burn the motor out. The whip puree button seemed to work better than the smoothie and crushed-ice ones, but my result, after much labor and time, was something consistent with extra crunchy peanut butter. I kept adding water to make it less thick, and thus perhaps more easily blendable, but that didn't seem to help much as I ended up with super soupy, crunchy hummus. Perhaps, I got a lemon, but given the reviews, I anticipated something far better than this.

Farrar,Crusher of expectations,"While there are some definite PROS (thick glass container, sturdy lid that fits snugly, ease of attaching container to base, snap tight spout for adding liquid or small ingredients while blending), the one big CON is that it doesn't do a good job. In my experience, it actually just blends; in the same way that a whisk would do. I'm a big fan of low budget blenders; they work for my simple needs. I just need it to make smoothies from both frozen ingredients & fresh. I always add plenty of liquid, so that's not an issue.

03/27/2017,United States,3,Coursing Rivers,Design flaws making blending an adventure,"I bought this because of the large jar capacity. I use my blender strictly for pureeing sauces, smoothies, cream soups, etc. Unfortunately, the size isn't much of a benefit because filling the jar even 3/4 full means the contents at the top don't get blended well.Everyone knows glass is heavy, and this jar is as well, making it more difficult to lift, scrape, and pour from. I would have preferred a plastic jar, but those were only available in smaller sizes.My biggest gripe, though, is the lid. The first time I used it, the contents sprayed up and forced the spout open slightly, dribbling sauce (that happened to be hot) all over the lid and even up onto my face. There's another flap on the lid and that shot open as well. When I twisted the jar off the base, the bottom came unscrewed and fell out. So that was a fine mess on the countertop.To use this, I need to make sure to re-tighten the base before adding anything to the jar, only fill it halfway, then hold down both the spout and the flap on the lid while blending. Kind of a hassle. It also doesn't puree very finely. If my food processor is worst at pureeing and my Bullet is best, this is somewhere in the middle.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3376G6CAAJIAH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,0,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

03/24/2017,United States,3,Jessica,I am excited to use it,"I have not used it yet, but I did turn it on. It is kinda loud, but I would say not much louder than my old blender. The reason I chose this one is because the base of the blender is wide, not tapered like most and like my old one. I really was assuming and thinking mine sucked at crushing ice because it was not getting to the bottom of the blender. This one boasts a lot about its power and ability to crush ice, so it better work. the lid, as other reviews state, is hard to get on and off, but as they said I am hoping it will loosen over time. The quality from further away looks wonderful, but upon close up inspection, it seems pretty cheap. The lid most of all. nice features, but you pay cheap you get cheap. has a 3 year warranty but does not include the glass (really?) or normal wear and tear and the manual states that this item is subject to normal wear and tear just from using it so it seems like warranty isn't much. the most quality of this is the glass so maybe that's is why you don't need a warranty on it.

After blending, scraping the sides, blending again and repeating the process, I checked the contents. Chunks of avocado were on the sides and the entire mixture was not blended as much as if I had stirred it a bowl. After pulsing, using every setting and speed and way too much time for such a task, I gave up and just blended my recipe with a spoon. The blades do turn when the machine is on, but they are very dull. Plastic knives are sharper. Rather than use this for any real kitchen duty, it is probably best suited for a child's play kitchen toy since there is no danger any fingers could be cut with these blades.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R240SQ7YE0FY0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,4,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

I haven't used any other blenders, but basically every blog and recipe site out there will tell you that you simply cannot make a good smoothie if you don't have a big-name $400 blender. Wrong-o. This thing purees frozen fruits and greens just fine. You may have to use a little more liquid than the recipe calls, but I've had no trouble making smooth, creamy, delicious smoothies. Just a hint, banana, avocado, nut butters, and yogurt can thicken up your smoothie a bit to compensate for extra liquid. I've just been throwing random crap in the blender, really, peeping at recipes for ideas. Haven't made a bad one yet. It does struggle a bit with frozen fruits, but I've found that cutting them up into smaller chunks really helps out. I do chop my kale pretty well, but whole spinach leaves and herb sprigs are just fine. Having to chop before blending may bother some, but I don't mind at all. Just don't expect to throw a whole frozen banana in there and it be okay (although a whole room-temp banana does blend!)

07/05/2016,United States,5,Scott,Great frozen smoothies. Better than blenders that cost triple this one!,"I've tried many blenders and this one does a fantastic job for sooo much less money. I bought it for a vacation home and liked it so much I bought another one to replace ours at home. I'm actually buying this again after having it over 2 years and leaving a spoon in it by mistake which stripped the gears. So yes, the gears are plastic and you can't blend spoons! But I blended ice every morning for 2 years without a problem, and let's face it, buying a blender with metal gears will cost a ton more, and the metal gears are made of zinc which is actually a softer metal than high-end plastics. I'm not saying these gears are high-end plastic, I have no idea, but I can replace this every time I leave a spoon in it and still save money... Also, I blend my smoothies VERY thick. So thick they usually won't come out of the blender without the help of a spoon or at least a lot of shaking. So yes, since I barely use any liquid, I need to know the tricks of how to blend ice. You can't just press a button and walk away, which isn't any different from ANY blender under $200. You need to start out just tapping the pulse button and occasionally shaking the blender until you get the contents rolling, and THEN you can press the slow button and every few seconds hit the next button up until you have a super smooth smoothie. Oh, and one last tip - I used to think it did a fantastic job at blending ice for such an inexpensive blender, but then I took the blades out and used my steak knife sharpener to sharpen the blades just a tiny bit. Not enough to make them thin like the blades in the nutri-bullet or anything, I didn't want them thin and likely to chip, I still wanted the edge to be a wedge and not a blade. But just that little bit of sharpening did the trick and my frozen smoothies are SO INCREDIBLY SMOOTH now.

I bought this blender to replace my 10 year old blender (maybe even older than that since it was my mother-in-law's blender). Anyway, with my old blender (R.I.P) I could toss in cubes of fruit/veggies, ice, yogurt all at the same time and get a smooth blend in less than 2 minutes, every time! This Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher...? It will not blend at all UNLESS you cut the fruit/veggies very VERY small. And even after that, you have to keep stopping the blender and stiring the fruit to make sure its getting its chance in the chooper. It takes like 10 minites to finally get a smooth sound of blending. And even after all that hard work, you're still left with pieces of fruit in your smoothie! So EXHAUSTING!!

I bought it exclusively for smoothies/shakes and it simply could not handle it. Putting a banana, liquid, ice, spinach, and water ... A fairly basic smoothly - and the blender couldn't grab anything into the blades. I had to open the lid multiple times (which seals REALLY well - great if you don't have to keep taking it on and off, but in this case, a royal pain) and using a spoon to try and smash the ingredients into the blades. It took forever and was more trouble than it's worth. Tried again this morning. Not a blender you want to deal with while trying to make breakfast and get out the door.Don't bother.

The only downside is that it's quite loud, my fiance has expressed annoyance at being startled awake at 5:15 in the morning when I make my smoothies for breakfast before work so I've opted for making them the night before. The blades are sharp and handle ice cubes with ease, no large clumps to speak of. I read reviews about the cap being difficult to remove but a little common sense makes that a non issue. Just don't mash it on over the glass, put it on lightly. It's really only there to keep liquid from spewing everywhere after all and honestly the spout feature on the lid isn't really necessary since the pitcher also pours in a very neat and precise stream, assuming whatever you're blending isn't super thick.

11/06/2015,United States,5,Active Man,"Good quality, powerful, turns Kale to liquid","Our old American-made blender, handed down from the sixties, started leaking. The seal had degraded over the years. No replacements could be found. The Wave Crusher had good reviews and the price was reasonable. There are lots of reviews so I will jump right to things we like.The glass pitcher is nice because it cleans up easy. Plastic can shrink or deform over time. This can lead to poorly sealing threads and gaskets if you plan on keeping the blender for years and years. Plastic will also develop tiny cracks and crevices that trap food particles, glass will not. Yes, probably nothing really to worry about but it is true.The lid fits tightly. It requires some wiggling to pop it off. This is good because the tight lid allows you to pour the pitcher without leaks, drips or the lid flying off when you tilt it.The motor runs smoothly compared to the old US-made blender. I imagine the gears are finer and don't grind as much. My wife makes iquid breakfast drinks made from kale, powder mix, fruits (frozen and fresh), soy milk and ice cubes (sometimes). The blender is able to mix, blend, crush all these foods nicely. The kale is converted into a drinkable liquid. I can hear the motor respond to frozen fruits and ice cubes but the blender easily handles this load.Clean-up can be a simple rinse. I often twist off the base and pop out the blades. It is easy to do.Overall I think this blender is a good value and does what it claims. Time will tell if the motor and blades last but that will depend a lot on what we throw at this blender. Grinding ice cubes is probably the most stressful job for a blender motor and blades. For basic home use this blender is a winner.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RS8CSHRJXIRCH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,23,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

07/21/2015,United States,3,kay,doesn't do what it says it does.,". I like the pitcher it opens and cleans easily it stores easy and doesn't take up much space. My issue is that it does not chop ice the way it says it does and I have to stand by the stupid blender open the top and shove down the ice then put lid on and try again. If I use as much liquid as it is says to (8oz) It doesn't always work it need more liquid and then my drinks are getting too watered down as the ice melts. I used it for an iced coffee beverage and it had ice chunks in it with the blended ice. I had to spit the ice out. I also tried it with frozen fruit to make a smoothie. I have to shove the fruit around with a knife so that it would blend. eventually it blended a little but I was still left with some milk in the bottom of the glass that didn't blend. I want to send t his back as defective it doesn't do what it says it does. I saw a wave action once and it was weird. and it was only after everything was completely liquid. if you want this fro crushed ice or smoothies, it won't work. go get another bleneder.

07/20/2015,United States,1,Jack of all Trades,This blender taught me how to hate.,"This blender taught me rage. I didn't know I could hate an inanimate object with so much passion before I started using this blender. I used to think that kind of hate was reserved for Nazis and University of Florida fans only, but no, I now can say I truly know myself better due to the experiences I've had with this blender.Let's start with the blending option. I think if you wanted to mix food dye in with some water you might be able to after 20 or 30 minutes of blending, but ice? Ha! Smoothies? Think again sucker! Whipped cream? More like stirred froth. See, when the masochistic designers unzipped their leather masks and peeled back their eye patches long enough to settle on giving this thing a function they discovered what might be one of the single greatest designs in all of the history of futility. This blender can mysteriously mix the areas in contact with the blades with extreme prejudice while leaving any areas of liquid or substance above the blades completely unperturbed. Amazingly this blender can render ice at the bottom into pure liquid water in seconds while leaving the ice above more frozen than Elsa's underwear.Some of you might be thinking well just push the other stuff down dummy and you'd be right if this weren't designed by Pol Pot clones raised in Chinese sweat shops. Pushing things down just begins the second round of mushed on the bottom and solid on the top. Now, given 30 or 40 minutes of free time you might be able to eventually go through enough cycles of this to get everything in the blender mixed, and kudos to you buddy for having the patience and virtue to go through that process. I lack these virtues, which is why I bought a blender that I was hoping would cut down on my smoothie making time. It did what I did not think was possible, which was add time to an already laborious process of making smoothies by hand.The lid requires a degree in mechanical engineering to get on and off smoothly, which is great if you enjoy splashing your kitchen with blender contents, but my wife is the lead cleaning manager of our kitchen and I'm pretty sure I'd be restricted from all kitchen privileges if I continued opening the pseudo-smoothies I've been making without covering myself and the blender in a beach towel first. I hate laundry so I'm going to pass on the extra towel duty. Amazingly my wife hates this blender even more than I do; when I asked her if she wanted to contribute to the review she asked me how to spell a 10 minute scream. I'm pretty sure she put an add on Craiglist for a hitman to come by and take this thing out.If I could give this thing less than 1 star I would, but then again if I could give this thing Ebola I would do that also. I hereby sentence this blender to the death of a thousand hammer smashes, I would not dare allow someone else to attempt to use it lest I be tried for crimes against humanity (which I think the UN Council may need to consider for Hamilton Beach).",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPWX7G9I5BCDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,29,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

We had a Magic Bullet before and I wanted something with more power to make my smoothies with frozen fruit and ice.Positives: This blender is a great price and it had good reviews. My husband loved it for milkshakes (ice cream, bananas, caramel, etc) and had no issues with it. I made homemade salsa in it and it worked great (tomatoes & juice, a few other veggies, etc) It is very heavy and well made, and it all comes apart to easily wash. Lid snaps well, never had any leaking problems.Negatives: HATE this blender for smoothies. It has 4 very small blades at the very bottom of the base and it can't handle frozen fruit or ice. Literally nothing happens, the fruit just gets bounced around, and the ice won't even be chipped. It has to have at least 1.5 cups of liquid before it will blend effectively, which either leads to watery smoothies or smoothies with extra fruit juice/milk, which adds unnecessary calories. I found all the buttons useless, it doesn't seem to do anything different no matter which button you press.All in all, it's fine if you're looking for a milkshake maker, or something to make purees in or things like that.

12/01/2014,United States,4,Scott T,"Totally decent, not quite amazing","After reading some of the reviews here, I figured this was the best blender without making a significant investment--and it turned out pretty true. While not an absolutely incredible blender, it gets the job done and at the right price. After owning and using it regularly for about a month now, I feel familiar enough with it to give it a review.The jar is glass, and seems sturdy--the blade assembly at the bottom comes apart for easy cleaning. The 'wave' refers to indentations in the glass on each side so the shape is less like a cylinder, making ingredients mix together a little better--and it seems to work, powdery/ground-up ingredients get evenly dispersed throughout.The cap is made of a reasonably flexible plastic. Other complaints that it's hard to remove are well-founded, but if you know what to expect, it's really not bad at all (for example, from the reviews, I assumed it to be a massive pain, when, in fact, it's only a minor inconvenience). The pour spout is very convenient and works well if you're afraid of spilling anything while fighting to get the cap off--and it does stick on there pretty good--and I've yet to have any leakage, even when blending large amounts (a hot tomato bisque filled nearly to the brim didn't leak at all--phew). I've also found that holding the handle and using that thumb to lever up the tab usually gets the lid off without much fuss.The blender itself is pretty loud, I think, movies/music/etc. have to be paused if it's nearby. There are 8 buttons implying 8 different speeds, but on my unit (maybe it's broken?) there doesn't seem to be much difference between the first 4 and last 4 buttons--that is, it seems to be 2 speeds, with the first 4 buttons all being low-speed, and the last 4 buttons being high speed. It still works more than fine, but I could see it causing problems if blending thicker items that need more incremental speed increases. The furthest left and furthest right buttons are pulse buttons--nice to have that in 2 different speeds on a blender at in this price range. Minimal 'hot electric' smell after running at a higher speed for about 30-40 seconds, but chews up ice and frozen fruits (from strawberries to broken-in-half bananas), so really what more can you ask for at this cost?",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1O425N4DW86TM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,9,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

I even let the fruit thaw for around 15 minutes before trying to blend.On day one, the only way I could get it to finally make a smoothie was to continually smush the fruit down with a spoon to the point where I had cut it up into small chunks myself and completely thawed it in the process. By this time, 10 minutes have gone by. This was the first time I used it.On day two, this blender could not even move a single partially frozen peach. Not even after adding yogurt. Not even after poking it with a spoon into every possible position...trying to cut it up myself like I had done the day before. Again, I spent 10 minutes trying to get it to work. Finally, I just put everything into my cheap Black & Decker food processor and made the smoothie with that. That's what I've had to do the past month, as we continue to search for a blender.

You can crush watermelon with your HANDS and this wouldn't do anything. After ten minutes of fiddling and just saying i'd have chunky watermelon juice, i went to lift it up and the bottom popped off, spraying pink watermelon juice EVERYWHERE. I have white wooden walls in my kitchen. Not only was i pink, but my walls are pink and some parts still are because it stained the walls. This was a gift from my husbands previous company, and it is just as horrible as his previous job was. I'd recommend just putting down the money for a blendtec or a vitamix.

I have also tried mixing ice cream and milk, same situation - lacks the power to mix.This is a cheap blender, plain and simple. When in use, it also ALWAYS overflows at the top, no matter how tight and secure the top is. Also, pouring drinks is always messy from either the top cover or after removing the top cover. Speaking of the top cover, it is EXTREMELY difficult to remove after mixing.

02/04/2014,United States,4,Melissa K. Cortes,Good- But wished it crushed ice better.,"Ok I spent a TON of time scouring over reviews of blenders in this price range. This one was the best value for the money.Pros- I love the large glass pitcher, it looks great on my counter. It's not nearly as loud as other reviewers said it would be. Its quieter than my last one. The cord is long enough. It is sturdy. It appears durable. It cleans very easy. It blends soft things together really well including spinach into my smoothie. The pouring spout in the lid is nice if you choose to put the lid on. The various settings are nice but I really only need one so I haven't tried the lower settings.Cons- It does not crush ice nearly as well as I'd hoped. The blades are too far from the sides and the ice just gets stuck there and never fully crushed. I make a double berry smoothie every morning and I ended up just taking the ice out altogether. Usually I only have 1 or 2 berries that don't get blended so it's not too bad. Maybe more liquid would solve this problem but I worry about it being too watery. It does not grind things well. My last blender was a cheap-o one and it blended steel cut oats to a nice powder for extra fiber in my smoothie. This one completely fails at that. The lid is also Extremely tight. So much that I pulled it off the second day and resolved to just hold the thing on rather than push it all the way down. This works totally fine and is a lot faster. The holes in the lid to add things are way too small. Sometimes you have to shake or jiggle it in order to get ingredients on top to get pulled down, but I think this just may be a blender thing. The space under the blades where the bottom ring comes off tends to get berry seeds stuck in it and I have to work a little harder to get it clean.Hope this helps the next potential buyer with your decision.All in all I really like it and I'm glad I got it.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFZ3PIIJUG6HP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,15,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

01/12/2014,United States,2,Karen Page,worked great.. for 2 months,"When i bought this blender 2 months ago, i was initially very pleased with the look, weight and performance. the only drawback i could see was the very cheap lid that neither conforms to the look of the rest of the blender, nor fits firmly into the glass container. in other words, you have to hold it on the entire time you're blending lest it go flying across the kitchen. anyway, this was barely a complaint because i figured the great price justified cutting a few corners and i'd rather them cut corners on a loose lid rather than a faulty jar/base/motor. [EDIT: I must have been sent a different sort of lid than some of the others who have written reviews. maybe they are testing out different types of lids.]unfortunately, the blender's performance has steadily declined to the point where it's now essentially useless. in my household, this blender gets frequent usage, mostly for making 1-2 smoothies/day from a combination of fresh and frozen fruit and almond milk. probably the frozen fruit is what dulled the blade but the photo on the article with a giant jar full of ice and fruit had me thinking the blender could handle it.incidentally, despite that photo, this blender was almost never great with ice. once or twice i got a nice slush but usually i end up with huge ice chunks, or if i keep blending, no ice at all, just a watered down smoothie. another drawback i was willing to overlook, and simply stopped adding any ice to my smoothies after the first few times.these days if i want to blend up a smoothie, i can look forward to spending 10-15 minutes stopping and starting the blender every 20 seconds and stirring things around trying to get it to break down the fruit. the amount of liquid is immaterial; the blade is simply too dull to be effective.this blender may still be recommended for people who only blend occasionally, or tend to blend softer foods like cooked vegetables for soup or something.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CK4F98QCIRH3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,1,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

I blend for approximately 30 seconds, or so.Actually, I just eyeball it until it looks right.One can use whatever vegetables and fruits they like - - -and/or whatever is available. Try about a 3 inch chunk ofcucumber and/or a jalapeno pepper for variety.I prefer organic and local whenever possible.This recipe makes several tall glasses of my living cocktail,and it fills me up and satisfies me very nicely for lunch.I enjoy this living lunch probably 4 or 5 times a week.Cleanup afterwards is a snap.I really, highly recommend this fine blender. . . . . . .And this is a great price for such a fine appliance.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ4QJ444KQYKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,3,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

Ended up going with Hamilton Beach as I have always had good luck with their products. My primary reason for purchasing this was to replace eggs/toast or cereal in the morning with healthy fruit smoothies. I couldnt be happier with this choice/purchase. The blending container is glass, which I like as it is solid and sturdy. There are multiple blending, chopping, grinding options for any type of mixing. I have only used the smoothie button so cannot comment on how the others do. Each and every smoothie has come out perfect. Not a nugget of ice or chunk of unblended fruit. Perfectly delicious everytime! Now, the downside...and its small...is that the lid is a bit difficult to get off. I love this product enough that the lid issue is not worth removing a star but for someone older or a senior, who may not have upper body strength, they may struggle a bit.

05/23/2013,United States,4,Marina,Does the job and makes great smoothies!,"I needed to get a decent blender for making smoothies until I can afford a Vitamix, and I chose this one because it appeared to have the highest wattage in its price range, and the reviews were all fairly solid. I was under the impression that I was getting a blender in the $80 - $100 range for $30 based on the reviews and specs, so I was excited to receive it. Sure enough, it is a pretty solid blender - the pitcher is made of glass and is heavy, which I don't mind because that to me means quality. The design is stylish, and the performance is satisfactory. You still have to pick up the pitcher and shake it sometimes when making smoothies, but it does crush the ice well if you add enough liquid (I use light vanilla Silk in mine). I usually let it run for about 30 - 45 seconds to make sure all the ice and nuts get blended. All in all happy with the performance.To address the lid issue - yes, it is kind of a pain to remove it sometimes, but it does get worn in and become easier to open with time. Also, I don't try to remove it by the pull tab, instead I make a hook with my finger and remove it from below the tab where the lid and glass meet.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VQ9ZDZKVHKQX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,11,B0081PTLGU,Color: Stainless Steel | Style: Blender,

It is not QUITE large enough to do the whole recipe, but there's just my husband and me, so I make 1/2 of the recipe, and this jar is perfect.I only took off a star because the lid is so darn hard to get on and off. I realize you want a nice tight fit, but I seriously struggle to get the lid on/off. I have learned to use the pour spout when they are thin enough to actually pour, but some mornings I make them a little thicker (they last longer that way) and I need the lid to come off.But if you're just looking for a sufficient blender to mix some frozen drinks, this one definitely fits!!",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GU5P72J1QKTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081PTLGU,26,B0086DY572,Color: Black | Style: Blender,

I used it for the first time this morning and am not disappointed! The old blender I have doesn't work for smoothies at all. The blades spin and nothing gets blended. This one is different. I put it in with my frozen fruit, yogurt, milk, etc and it blended nicely. I did have to go in the jar and mix it with a spoon a couple of times to encourage the blending (not while it was on!) and it came out smooth as silk with absolutely NO fruit chunks.

But I do like the wide speed range this blender offers. It is quite fast and not obnoxiously noisy.Our old one (Back to Basics) cost $15 more and offered a side spout for pouring. Of course, after pouring you still had to remove the jar to pour what remained at the bottom below the spout. But the jar was easier to handle since it weighed a lot less with most of the liquid poured out already.But I like this one better, because it pours so nicely with hardly a drip to clean up. Plus, the blades do such a great job there essentially no residue at the bottom after everything is poured out. That was not true with our old one which would routinely leave a few small chunks of fruit at the bottom, plus you had to take apart the side spout to clean it also.It lasted almost 7 years, so can't complain.But the Crusher does a very good job plus has a few extra features that make it very useful, practical and easy to clean.

04/24/2021,Canada,1,Amazon Customer,Plastic on base very flimsy cracked immediately,"I purchased this Hamilton Beach blender Mar. 19/21. I bought it because I owned a similar Hamilton Beach blender for years without any real problems and I wanted a glass carafe. When I ordered and received the blender I noticed the design was different, it seemed less sturdy, the plastic parts were flimsy, buttons that used to be flush against the blender now awkwardly stuck up from the blender, instead of the blender sitting on top of the motor it sat into it, it was loud and there was a slight rubber burning smell when I used it. I used the blender a handful of times, taking it apart to clean it and reassemble it every time. About 2 weeks into having it as I’m putting the blade back into the carafe and screwing the base on the bottom of the carafe I hear a click. Thinking nothing of it I put the carafe on the blender and blend my drink. Right away I notice liquid leaking from the bottom. I take the blender apart and see that the plastic base that screws onto the carafe has cracked. I email Hamilton Beach for a replacement part and they respond stating that they normally don’t cover the cost of shipping but will waive the cost of shipping this one time. I received my replacement part and used my blender a total of 2 times before the same thing happened again. I was screwing the base onto the bottom of the carafe and heard a click. I used the blender and liquid leaked out the bottom. Needless to say I’m not contacting Hamilton Beach for another replacement. This is a design flaw, the plastic on the base is very flimsy.

I could see how it’d crack If you cycle hot water into this after cold, plastic base is a bit thinner and lighter plastic than it could be but with care should last all the same. Just has the same “magic bullet” style rubber spinner that could get worn with careless use.Easy to clean, just need a longer brush. The lid itself is odd there’s a small plastic flap that opens for pouring but it’s not all too secure I could see it snapping off as well, again the lid being plastic if the cheaper variety.Good for general use, maybe not a forever appliance.

Best fit would be a blender for one unless you both have really small drinks. It does suck down towards the blade, as long as it's not thick. My mixture with spinach, yogurt and frozen fruits would just hang there, I would have to open it open and get it moving again myself with a spoon. Same thing with the easy pour lid. If it's a thick smoothie, you're going to have a mess. By the time I tipped it enough to get it to come out, it was leaking out the original spout as well. It also sounds right out of the box like the blades need oil, it's like nails on a chalkboard. It will do for now, but I can't wait to replace it.
