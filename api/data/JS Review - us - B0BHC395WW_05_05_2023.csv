"04/29/2023","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","User","Disc Over Digital, Great Bundle","When I saw this for $510, essentially getting $50-$60 off God of War Ragnarok, I was very happy. I missed the original PS4 era and only recently got one second-hand to play all the Playstation exclusives. I blasted through them all and then was ready for PS5 exclusives like Rift Apart.-Having been a past digital-only console owner on the Xbox side, I will say this -- I believe in the advantages of physical games. Yes, most game disks currently only hold an access key to play a game and not the actual files for the game itself, BUT having a disk means having more options. You can resell a disk. You can hold it physically in your hand. You can trade it with friends. And, sort of a big thing -- if you ever lose your account for some reason, YOU DON'T LOSE ALL THE DIGITAL GAMES tied to your account.-My advice is don't get sucked into digital gaming just because it's cheaper to initially get a Series S or a digital PS5. You won't physically own any license keys to the games if you go digital. If Microsoft of PS5 servers or accounts ever go down, all your stuff gets lost. They already hold our game saves hostage -- remember when you used to be able to put saves on a flashdrive and not have them tied to your account? -- so don't let them hold your actual games hostage, too. This is my advice for a lot of media nowadays. Buy hard copies. Movies, music, games, books -- all of it. Otherwise, you're essentially paying ownership-level prices to rent electronically.-Why am I fine with a digital code for Ragnarok in this bundle? It is annoying -- I'd rather have a disk, BUT you can't get a disk for this game right now at the price of $10 (assuming you buy this bundle at the sale price of $510). If you're itching to play Ragnarok right now and feel like it's the right time to upgrade, this is the best deal. I imagine Ragnarok won't ever be on sale for $10 -- PS4 God of War still sells for like $20 by comparison, so this bundle is a great deal.-Not Amazon's fault, but I feel iffy about the white plastic. It looks cool and futuristic, but white plastic can get gross over time. I would suggest keeping the console and controller out of direct sunlight and having regular (gentle) cleanings. Not sure how I feel about protective decals at this time, but that middle black plastic bar of the console scratches super easily, so I'd say maybe consider a center decal sooner rather than later.--My console arrived neatly, not really anything to note. One white panel on it seems to have a faint scratch or mould mark, but it didn't really bother me or take away from the PS5 experience.-Hope this helps you all! Trying to give my honest opinion as someone who adores all sorts of games and all sorts of consoles. Good luck!","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IJ20Z41P90HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","8","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

"04/27/2023","United States 🇺🇸 ","1","thatguyuknow210","Why is it so glitchy right out of the box? And where is my REFUND?!","I finally buy a console expecting too much I guess. I got this PS5 thinking it is top of the line, but it was glitchy af! I got the Ragnarok bundle, and I first notice weird glitches on the menu screen. Some of the icons would be blank or distorted and would take time to fill in, or there would be lines running through the images. That was my first red flag. Well ok, so what does the game look like? After the installation of the included game, I gave it a go. It didn't take long to realize there were problems with the system. When playing the game, there would be brief pauses and skips when the action got heavy, like when swinging against multiple foes or when using a special move etc. I reset it a few times and tried updating (even though it was a really fresh install) and after about 2-3 hours of play I realized that either Playstations suck, or I got a dud. Either way, I'm not satisfied and returned it. Well its been 10 days and nothing yet as I still have no confirmation that they have received it. My UPS tracker says they received it 6 days ago in AZ. Why the delay? I can understand a refund taking a week or two I guess, but Ive never had an Amazon return take so damn long just to acknowledge they got it. Starting to feel like I'm getting screwed...","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RT9IQOVO1I75W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","2","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

"04/05/2023","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Michael","Crazy-Fast Delivery. Console Works Perfectly. Glad These are Easier to Buy Now.","If there's a chance for you to order one of these and get 1-Day shipping, I highly recommend that. Mine was delivered in perfect condition and it worked amazingly well out-of-the-box. Overall 5 stars.In case there are any buyers out there that want one of these and are new to how they work, or want to know how to set it up best for their family, here are some things to know:1. The God of War Ragnarkök game comes as a digital code, so expect that versus the physical game (I thought it would be a disc, but that's probably because my expectations of bundles are still stuck in the PS3 era). I redeemed my code, but I've not loaded the game yet (when it's nearly 100 GB, I'm going to wait on this until I've earned the Platinum of Final Fantasy VII Remake).2. The controller works REALLY well and the charging cord is efficient, though if you can get a dedicated charging stand, that wouldn't hurt since the cord can sometimes be finicky. I think these can be purchased for $25ish, so if you have the cash to spare, that's a worthwhile addition (it also apparently helps the battery life of the controller).3. If you're new to how the PS5 works, here's one thing to keep in mind: PS5 games can only be played if they're stored in Console Storage. If you plug in an external drive, PS5 games stored there cannot be played. Doing that just saves you the hassle of reinstalling them. From what I under, internal storage is expandable, but you need to buy a special hard drive chip-thing dedicated for the PS5 to make this work. I've not invested in this yet, so if you stick to the storage you have, prioritize the PS5 games you want to play.3.5. If you use an external drive, have that be dedicated to your old PS4 games. They'll play like a dream.4. When it came to transferring console data, it was done within an evening for me. If you're starting fresh on the console, don't worry, but if you are transferring data from a PS4, expect to play your games to be playable in about 2-4 hours. Make sure to look up guides if you've never done the transfer before. Videos are also really good resources, too. Also, definitely use an ethernet cable to help with the process.5. Make sure Game Sharing is turned on if you have a family. This is buried in the settings, but if you find it, this will allow you to have the various profiles play the games the others have bought. Save you money from re-buying a game all over again.6. The disc drive can run loud when it's first loading up the game. It'll make you wonder, is it ok?! Don't worry. It is actually ok.Those are the big things I think are handy to be aware of before buying one of these. Overall, I have no complaints. It's done everything I've wanted it to and it's helped my brothers and I play together far more easily.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36ZKOXO431V37/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","90","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

     I received a defective PS5 console too (5 days old). It reboots by itself while playing games. It happened few times but when I checked the system error log, there was nothing there, so I ignored them. Today after a cold start, within 5 minutes it shutdown by itself as soon as I started a game with a CD in, then it refused to start-up saying console is too hot to start. Not sure how its get too hot just after a cold start within 5 minutes. Did not even get a chance to play the game. So something seriously wrong with these units. I have bought few other games and accessories as well.

"03/28/2023","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Taon","Great price, great bundle, not so great design.","For those who actually care, there are three models of the PS5. A 1000, 1100 and 1200 series. The 1200 model actually uses less energy to prevent it from overheating and its lightest version of the PS5. In the product description it says this bundle comes with a 1100 model PS5. However, when I got mine it was actually the 1200 model. Which makes sense since it was so hard to keep PS5s in stock that most of the ones you see now WILL be the 1200 version unless you buy it used.I purchased mine when it went on sale for $509, which was an unbelievable price. That means you’re getting God of War for $10! My only complaint is that Sony didn’t put any special designs on the console or the controller to indicate this was a God of War bundle. Sony have released themed consoles in the past and I was hoping that this would be one. They actually did create a God of a War themed controller but unfortunately it doesn’t come with the bundle, which is a shame because it’s pretty cool looking.Lastly I’m a person who used all of my Xbox’s as media hubs for watching Tv and movies. After hearing how PS5s were overhearing I was worried about leaving my PS5 on all day. Though I just got my PS5, I have friends who use theirs in the same fashion and they have not had any issues from their system overheating. They use their systems to watch Tv and game, it’s set to go in rest mode when it’s not in use and they have yet to have any issues.I will say that if you are planning on getting a PS5 you may want to see what deals you can get on a compatible SSD. The PS5 only has a little under 700gb of storage and games(digital or physical) can take up a lot of storage. God of War takes up approximately 84 Gb of storage. Ultimately this is a great bundle and this is the perfect time to pick them up, while they are available and on sale.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15SHWVJPBUUYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","71","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

Astro's Playroom that is fun but kinda short. Then you have the code for God of War Ragnarok that actually gives you the PS4 and PS5 digital versions. The only thing that I did not like about the console is that the controller battery does not last long. Is like 2 to 3 hours when the Dualshock 4 lasted about 5 to 6.

I didn’t even realize you could install another SSD to expand storage until I read the manual so that was just icing on the cake for me. This might be the first PlayStation console with an HDD/SSD that I don’t fill up within a year or so and I love that. Not to mention if you install the SSD then it doesn’t have the limitations that an external one would have so great job Sony for offering good options. The ordering process was abysmal.No real information about when/if you’ll get the invite, no details about whether there will be a console without the game bundle available, no way to switch your preference after the fact. Seems intentionally set up to be unnecessarily difficult. In fact if you just look at Sony’s website you realize there is no shortage of these, you can buy one at any point direct from Sony with no issue and no waiting and no invite, so this is an Amazon problem. I don’t think I’ll buy any consoles or actually any games from Amazon anymore. This and their preorder failures have made me consider other options. GameStop and Walmart and other places don’t seem to have the same issues.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHLIN9FVGRY0T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","16","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

I'm not sure - because it's more of a 3 - 31/2.To start; it's bulky, awkard shaped, and not impressive.I have a PS4 Star Wars edition (comes with more storage and more USB ports) sure its a special edition and that should be expected from an older model PS4, but better than a PS5?  unfortunately.. yesI use an external HD for extra storage, but I'm also using a VR (1st edition) headset which (with the VR connector to USB adaptor) takes the available USB port - no external HD.The plus - PS5 games are better (period).So I decide to purchase the VR2, and its sleaker and not as constraint as VR1 - it also uses the USB-c port opening the other USB ports for other choices.  Unfortunately, dont expect to use those PS4-VR games (not compatible).To conclude, sure the games are better, but how much better? - not much, and (in hindsight) if I was alerted about the PS5 avaialblity I wouldn't take it.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK8AYZC32AQHP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","3","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

Had to do investigation to discover the issue behind the error code provided then needed to ship the console back to Sony for repair. Overall the process was simple and relatively painless, but annoying this needed to be done on arrival and needed to wait another 2 weeks to use the console. Just an FYI, sending the console in either results in your original console being repaired OR Sony will send a refurbished console instead. Fortunately I received my original purchase back.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NFSZB9FU9AU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","0","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

With the push of a button I was able to transfer any digital games from my ps4 to ps5.  Most do not include the haptic feed back just better graphics.  The Last of Us Part 1 was my ps5 splurge.

Naturally, I did not want to return the whole system and try again so I contacted Amazon customer service.  It was definitely a hassle to connect with a real person through chat as the customer service on order issues does not allow for much flexibility of issues and the initial chats were useless AI, but I did eventually connect with someone who was able to give me a partial refund so that I could but the correct game. As for the system, it was easy to set-up and it works terrific, but the games take forever to download. I am used to plugging in a system, inserting a disk and playing within minutes. The game I downloaded for this system took about an hour. Even a game I bought on disk took several minutes to download before I could play.

At the price point I was really wishing it wasn’t too good to be true, but alas, I am met with bunk product once again.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iijm-zQYL._SY1600.jpg","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3W3IHPN7O3V4F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","5","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

The top rated games such as God of War: Ragnarok and Horizon: Forbidden West are good games, but not great.  Graphics are great, but they are a grind to play.  A game system is only as good as their games.  I also have Nintendo Swith that I bought for my kid, and Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the best game I have ever played and is not a grind to play.  Both my kid and I have played it at least twice.  We are looking forward to Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which I have pre-ordered.  The Switch is also cheaper.  If you've got to have the latest and greatest system, then overspend on the Playstation or XBox, but if you're smart, you won't fall for the hype.

"02/17/2023","United States 🇺🇸 ","1","John Shaffer","Probably better off buying at an actual store","It arrived and seemed fine until I plugged it in. Heard the disc drive make a loud noise and was almost certain that it wasn't supposed to (never had a PS5 so I wasn't positive). Turns out I was right, as I was setting the console up, it told me to insert a game disc and it would not allow me to insert one without resistance. All of the troubleshooting involved taking the console apart... No thanks.Also, I didn't even realize it until now that I'm sitting down and thinking about it because I never even really got though setting up the console, but I never even found the code for God of War in the box.So I was sent an incomplete box with a defective or maybe previously used PS5 (I say that because when I went and got one from Walmart, it had two stickers to open the box, one being a holographic PlayStation sticker. The one I received from Amazon did not have the holographic one so I can only assume it was previously opened).So instead of getting my console and being able to enjoy the last few days playing, I had to wait and spend another $600 to get a working console. And who knows how long it'll take to get the refund, so as of now I have what amounts to a $1200 PS5 until I get it. Will never buy a console online again, not worth the risk. Just go get it in person even if you have to wait longer for whatever reason.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NWLSCR0NBVCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","11","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

The PS5 graphics are so superb and being able to play PS4 games is also an amazing treat. The controller has an amazing feel to it as well. You do not even have to get a headset because in the middle you can hear the audio, but if you prefer using a headset for playing online then you should.I love that it included God Of War Ragnok. It is one of the best God of War games in a while. Especially with the graphics on the PS5. It felt like I was watching a movie and playing it at the same time in 4D.Highly recommend this bundle to anyone looking for a PS5 and a good game to go with it.The link to purchase is: https://amzn.to/3xjW0k6","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31qHbF6U-qL._SY1600.jpg","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D8IHEK48GCA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","0","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

"02/14/2023","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Nick","Greatest purchase I've made in the last 10 years","I have the series s xbox and I bought this expecting slightly better performance. I was pleasantly surprised to see it was far superior, the exclusive games are so far above what xbox has to offer that I'm considering selling mine. And of course the remote was mind blowing, descriptions of how haptic feedback feels don't do it justice, you just have to try it. I would highly recommend trying the free game that the ps5 comes with (Astros playroom) not only is it a nostalgia trip but it is very high quality and it shows off the ps5 and remote like no other. It has been worth every penny and then some. If you care even a little about games, it is 100% worth it. Make sure to have your graphic settings setup for performance though, 120 fps still has insane details with the bonus of an additional 60 fps.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NL1SBWTLIOR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","9","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

"02/04/2023","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","H Giersberg","Do NOT set your machine up vertically","I'm so glad to see these consoles are available. I hope the scalpers that have held these machines hostage for the last 2 years are stuck with hundreds of thousands in inventory. You already know all about the PS5. Let me add a few suggestions.... First, set it up horizontally. If you watch electronic fix-it videos like I do, you know the main chip in the PS5 is connected to the heat sink using Liquid Metal. Some technicians are starting to say that after 2 years of use that the Liquid Metal pools at the bottom of the chip in a vertical setup. Next, if you plan to move your PS5 from room to room or house to house as you play, treat your HDMI connector very carefully. In fact, get a HDMI extension connector or adapter so you never unplug your primary cord from the motherboard. There are a ton of videos out there showing these connectors mangled or ripped from the motherboard. Third, if you disconnect your fan from the motherboard to dust it out, be careful. These connectors are also getting ripped from the motherboard. Get a high capacity SSD made specifically for the PS5. Buy a cheaper one and the data transfer speed will hamstring you. SMD components on the PS5 can fail. If you have your machine repaired, choose you repair tech carefully. Some do not have the experience required and cause new problems. I'd suggest northridgefix dot com. Check out his YT channel and you will see all the things I've mentioned. Don't sell or chunk your PS4. Dust it out and store it in case you ever do need to get your 5 repaired. Have fun playing. My 1st grade grandson loves playing on my 5 but so far he wants to save his gift cash at home and keep playing on his Dad's 4. Maybe he's smarter than me but I want to me able to play the game Marz and Cynthetic are playing on their channels.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGKENS2XZGTAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","2","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

"02/03/2023","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","L.L.V","Worth it.","I was kind of apprehensive about getting one because of the reviews I read about people getting “used” PS5’s or ones that broke within hours of play. The negative reviews always stand out.PS5 is well worth it for me. I am very happy with mine and am glad I got one. I got the Ragnarok Edition and I did read that it is a DIGITAL version not a disc copy. Don’t know why people leave bad reviews because of this. READ the description I guess. I have almost a month of play on mine and it’s running great. I immediately got upgrades for mine. Camo plates with better ventilation, cooling fans (highly recommend this no matter how long you play for), and LED lights.The first thing I noticed is how fast things load up. From the time you turn it on- your actually playing your loaded game in less than 45 seconds. Plus updates and initial game loads - none of them have been over 20 minutes. I remember PS4 days where game updates and initial load times took HOURS!!! So much so that I always knew I’d be playing the game either the next day or later in the day if things were kicked off in the morning.Graphics are a massive improvement. Even for remastered PS4 games.The controller improvements are substantially better too. The new haptics are much better.Overall PS5 is a major improvement over PS4. Glad I got one.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ECd+I+pUL._SY1600.jpg","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19NO60PPDB6CX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","26","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

Both consoles A+","Since I have both consoles and have no bias, I’ll tell you what I like about this console.Graphics: A+ (Same as Xbox) amazing + fastController: A+ (Better than Xbox) definitely higher quality. Both are comfortableUI: A (Personally like it better than Xbox)  Feels more streamlined to me, but similar to XBoxIf you want to try a game out to test performance, I’d recommend God of War: Ragnorak. The game has top reviews across the board and you will be mesmerized by the graphics and smoothness. I literally didn’t progress for a long time because I was stopping to look at all the details and clarity. Mind blowing how far things have come. A+ investment/Showcase Final thoughts: Regardless of choice, PS5 and Xbox series X offer improvements over their predecessors. Better graphics and WAY faster speeds. Load times are not an issue anymore and never have I noticed having to wait for anything. That is probably the best improvement in terms of upgrades other than graphics quality. Wether you get PS5 or Xbox series X, you’ll be happy. The only reason to choose one over the other comes down to 2 things:-Exclusive games for the console-What consoles your friends have to party up. (Sometimes this won’t matter, but it’s based on the game and crossplay)","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O5XXM9KPSLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","20","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

It’s beyond ridiculous I had to be “invited” by Amazon to purchase one. Sony needs to be pumping these out & putting them on every store shelf! They also need to lower their ridiculous price on this toy. My heart breaks for all the people who can’t afford one. Greed, as usual, is the cause.  I’m also unimpressed that the PS5 takes up memory room for the game you want to play, using a disc or not. You should be able to insert a game disc, play the game and take it out when done playing. It should NOT take up memory, which is a glaring failure on Sony’s part. This PS5 does not have a lot of memory room. As for me, I’ll take the original Play Station with game cartridges that had nothing to do with memory, just game play. Yup, I’m that old! Sony needs to show up & step up!","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2A0JJ8QWILS9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","0","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

I was able to order immediately and have it arrive on time. A month later and we are loving it!I had trouble finding the code in the box at first but ended up finding the paper for the game. I only got this bundle because I just wanted to get a PS5 no matter what and this was the first listing that I got the invite for. I am SO glad we got this one. I never played the first game, but this has already shot to the top of my favorite games list.The storyline is engaging and the graphics are beautiful. I’m excited to use the PS5 as a Blu-ray player, as well. If you’re getting a PS5, definitely try to grab this bundle specifically. This game is AMAZING.My one gripe is that I wish there had been a bit more padding when shipped, like maybe some paper stuffing.

"01/23/2023","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","mdb","PS5 is good, the video game had bugs but thry were fixed!","I bought several games for the new PS5 and they work fine. At first, I thought Ragnarok GOW might be the best game I ever played, but bugs and glitches began to occur with increasing frequency. The severe cases involved main story ( so you cannot avoid the issue) villains that continuously and immediately respawn after I (my main character) have defeated them. For example, on one occasion I defeated two easy attackers and a 3rd very difficult one only to turn around and the very same 3 attackers jumped me again...and again...etc. I did escape and just avoided that confrontation, only to later encounter the Flame Phantom ( difficult to beat ) and, once again, I moved my character a few feet and out he jumped again! In tracking one of the dragons, I beat 2 trolls (protecting the path to the dragon showdown) possessed by 2 pixie-type villains (Nokkens) and, as I left the arena, I could hear a Nokken resume his chant and atroll growling again--I returned to fight again, only the pixie was frozen in place and invulnerable and the troll proceeded to bash my brains out at leisure...so, I cannot beat the troll(s) and cannot fight the dragon.In ALL these cases, I tried reloading checkpoints, restarting the console, reloading earlier saves, to no avail. Today, I tried pursuing the adventure with one of the other main characters (Atreus) but he got stuck with Thor in a dead-end ice tunnel that is supposed to open up when you point a mask object at it, but does not open up...meanwhile, villains continuously jump out of the ground and walls and proceed to bash my brains out.I prefer games that give me a fighting chance not get my brains bashed out.I am attempting a new download (which takes hours) and will try again. It's too bad...turned out to be so disappointing. If the new download changes things, I will update this post.UPDATE2 days after I wrote the above, an update downloaded to my game when I opened it. I am v happy to say that the update resolved ALL the issues I had, so I changed my rating from 2 to 5...definitely the best game I have ever played!N","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NK9P0R8GRXRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","36","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

Windows 11 Pro is great; function just as the information from Dell predicted.  It is fast, smooth, wireless and better with e-net (adaptor not included) voice clarity of speakers and camera are outstanding. Backlit keys are not as distinct would have been better for my eyes, however acceptable in darkened environment. Tablet form and touch screen only complete the picture though finding a Dell stylus required some effort. no number pad is the only inconvenience, but adaptability or add-on is what makes computing enjoyable! lastly, the keyboard key travel is a plus for me slight impairment of little & ring finger left hand is compensated for easily compared to others I have tried. just wonderful for this man of 70 years.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6XQ0KQNB4D8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","2","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

He was needling me for the whole of November and December about how he just knew what I had gotten him. That he knew he was getting a PS5, but people I tell you I cannot keep a secret to save my life and this time I was able to.

"01/17/2023","United States 🇺🇸 ","1","Kenny","The PS5 is great. But the controllers already having pro lems after barely a month.","1st, I'd like to say I love my new Playstation 5. All the games I had for PS4 are compatible and can be played on it. That's the only thing I cared about console wise. However I bought the console in December 2022. It's now January of 2023 and I'm already having problems with the controllers.1. The left bumper gets stuck after I press it. It doesn't look stuck so I don't usually notice until Kratos decides to throw his axe randomly.2. There seems to be some sort of delay/ controller drift with the right stick.3. I don't see the point of the Duel sense controller. It looks good, but I don't particularly like it when the triggers vibrate. It might make the triggers more prone to malfunctions. But that's more of a personal gripe I guess.If anyone knows how I can get the controller fixed or replaced please comment with the contact info. I can't play God of War Ragnorock till these problems are fixed. Also you can use the ps4 controller for the homescreen but not any games? Why Sony?Anyway all and all console is great controller is crap4/10. You can't play games without a controller that works well.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24JFNPWN0RYAZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","5","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

"01/13/2023","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Dan","terrible ergonomics otherwise solid new console","The unit/box is huge and aesthetically unappealing. That makes it difficult to place on and around your entertainment center, particularly if your setup is in a room that sees a lot of guests. More frustrating is that the curvature makes the unit awkward to place. The circular stand doesn’t have a secured attachment point when in horizontal mode, and I’ve already had it slip off while trying to access the back panel USB ports. Lastly, the curved top means you have to be incredibly careful even temporarily placing objects on top, such as the CD case or PS5 controller while load a disc into the system.System OS and controller ergos continue to be superior to those of the Xbox line. I have not played anything on either the Xbox Series X or PS5 that could not have been played without complaint on the previous generation consoles. We’re what? 1? 2? years into these releases, and while load times are clearly faster, I find myself playing significantly more PS4 titles (ports) than games truly made for PS5, and the same is true for Xbox, so my recommendation as of January 2023 is chill on trying to get your hands on these new gen consoles. At the moment, their appeal is more of a mirage than real - like bragging rights that you were finally able to get one.FWIW, my assessment of the games is based on gameplay using a 77” LG C2 OLED with HDMI 2.1 and a 7.1 ch surround system powered by a Denon AVR-930H. I certainly have the hardware to take advantage of next gen console gaming, but as I said, there’s nothing to play that makes the experience palpably better than previous gen consoles…yet. So still no rush to buy this thing. I would try to hold off until SONY releases a slim version, hopefully in early 2024. Good luck. Have fun.edit: unlike Xbox, games cannot be played directly from external drives, so while you can download and store them on a USB drive, you still have to manually copy games onto the internal drive, which also means having to decide what to remove to make room for the new game. it’s unnecessarily inconvenient in my opinion, but it’s typical of sony and nintendo who are both more guarded and restrictive than microsoft.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3REP9WHHJP4Q9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","28","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

"01/12/2023","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Breann Belluz","Major upgrade, worth it, and awesome! ❤️🥰","Omgosh. I’m so glad I bought the ps5 when I got a chance. I pressed the invite button on Amazon and wasn’t expecting it to accept it  so soon. I immediately purchased it as soon as I got the invite. It was easy to install and sign up with no problems. I owned a ps3 and I wasn’t sure if I was going to upgrade it to a ps4. Glad I didn’t buy a ps4 until I heard that the ps5 will come out. As soon as I heard there was going to be a ps5. I was like, nope, I’ll wait. Lol. Glad I waited until ps5 came out. Major upgrade. I am glad I got it. I never owned a new PS system before so I acted like a little kid even though I am 31 year old female. I didn’t grew up with it. Only watching my guy cousins play the old systems. The only system I own now is the Nintendo Switch. Now I finally own a ps5. Now I can finally play ps4 and ps5 games since it’s backwards compatibility. Also I love how the ps5 is simple. It’s perfect for a simple minimalistic person like me to have. It’s also fast and graphics are nice to see since I wear glasses. Can’t believe after two years, it’s high in demand and almost impossible to get. It’s slowly becoming available for people to purchase it. As soon as you see one. Get it as soon as possible. I’m a very picky person when it comes to buying a PS system. So i am happy. Good luck to those that are searching for one to buy and to have. Thank you god for answering my prayers. ❤️🙏","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V8CXLRHAWMRG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","0","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

I only have positives for this purchase, as it is amazing! My sole disappointment concerning this bundle was that I was expecting the game to be in disc form with the case in the box but I was surprised that it was just a card with a code for the digital game. I like to showcase my game cases to show which games I have and I was expecting a disc game with the case but all in all, I still have a superb console and a $70 game for $10 less.

"01/08/2023","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","ChefBryComedy ","Been waiting forever to finally upgrade from the PS3.","As an almost 50 year old who is not a huge gamer and has been waiting forever to finally upgrade, I'm glad that I finally did. I wasn't sure if this was going to be a good decision or not, but really it's been better than expected! First, it's almost paid off due to Christmas money. Second, I was concerned about the cost of building a collection of games. But due to the fact that there's so many games and so many sales, especially on the games I like, I have a small collection of fun games already in many different genres that feels well rounded, and didn't cost a fortune to get! I'm slowly reacquiring my favorite games like the God of War franchise and the Arkham Batman games, while discovering old arcade games that are super cheap, as well as newer games like Spiderman Miles Morales, Spiderman, Ghostbusters, Creed boxing, and Stray all on sale. It's a great time to be gaming, and while I generally am not a big gamer, I went through a phase where I was gaming a lot just before meeting my wife Rebecca, and then life got busy, crazy, and wild for a good long time. But now I have a little bit more stability, and while still busy as heck, I have a couple of hours here and there to enjoy. I even bought Trivial Pursuit just to get Rebecca into the fold. She doesn't really even know how to use the dualsense controller! So I'm trying to get her involved enough to learn how to use the controller and navigate around in different ways. Anyway, very pleased with the purchase! I've played a little bit and it's a great experience. Quite a step up from the PS3, and a good time to get back into the gaming world. I'm glad that the shortage is ending, and I'm glad I did this when I did. Had I bought it in 2020 it probably would have been a weirder experience. I feel like gaming is finally at a place where oldsters, youngsters, and middle of the roadsters like myself can find something to enjoy.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KoIsn9GOL._SY1600.jpg","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXR0Q3HPSJTX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","51","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

I reluctantly purchase the PS5 after sending back the xbox series x; I just wanted to see what the hype was about.I want to make it clear that I only played 2 games so far - FIFA 19 and Skyrim.And let me say that 60 frame per second display sold me. I am experiencing Skyrim in a different light.I only had the system for 1 week now, and on my off days I've been planted in my bedroom wasting precious time away.I don't believe there are quality games out there in relation to the PS4; however if someone skipped the PS4 era, I would highly recommend them to get the PS5 and play those PS4 games.The remote resonates quality (versus the xbox controller which feels and looks flimsy); very responsive. I played for 6 hours straight, and never felt digital fatigue/pain.Highly recommended system.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2951NMIATHK32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","0","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

"12/28/2022","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Steven B","It's the next gen Sony Console and it is what it is.","So after 2 years, I've finally gotten a PS5.  It is everything I expected and nothing less.  Granted I didn't have too many expectations.  Graphics are definitely a step up from the PS4. Faster load times for sure. Controllers are comfortable and familiar with a few added features such as vibrating triggers and a built in microphone.  Some not so great things about it could be led by the ridiculously expensive cost to add on to this already expensive machine.  Standard controllers start at 79usd before sales and discounts.  The built in memory storage is pretty lame and it costs upwards from 100usd and beyond to upgrade to any quality internal ssd.  Lots of good options out there for that though so pick and choose as you'd like.  Don't even get me started on the PSVR2 price tag!! If that's your thing.  I mean overall, the PS5 is next gen and it is fun, but at what cost.  However, at this point in the PS5's existence, I don't feel like my PS4 is obsolete yet. Mostly everything that the PS5 has, is just a tad better than what the PS4 offers.  If you're on the fence about the next gen systems but not suffering from FOMO(fear of missing out) then go ahead and wait a little longer.  Nothing super extraordinary about the PS5 yet.  But if you have the means to spend on it, then go ahead, you won't be disappointed, just don't expect this thing to be revolutionary as of now.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OLW77VPJFI33/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","10","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

"12/28/2022","United States 🇺🇸 ","3","PRNLM","TRY A CONTROLLER FIRST","Longtime PS user. Had four DS4 controllers on our PS4 and have put so many hours in on them that all the texture is polished off on all surfaces. They have been perfect.We also have multiple Switch systems, a Wii system, a Wii U system, a Sega Genesis, a Sega Saturn, a SNES, an Atari 5200 and an Atari 2600 in house. We are not new to gaming systems.The PS5 unit itself is everything you hoped for and more. It runs PS4 games. The PS5 games that show what the console can do will blow your mind. The UI has been revamped, in most ways for the better. Great, great, great all around.ONE PROBLEM (and it's BIG)Everyone in this house gets serious hand pain with (and only with) the Dual Sense controllers for the PS5. All the other controllers for all the other consoles, no problem.The Dual Sense controllers? Sore and blistering thumbs, numb fingers, serious wrist and thumb pain, and serious joint pain in middle fingers, among other things, depending on the person. Like, we are seriously disappointed after finally getting our hands on a PS5 to find that we don't like to play it for more than 20-30 minutes because it makes the hands hurt. This is with hand sizes ranging from pre-teen girl to >6ft 250lb man, i.e. a wide variety of hand sizes.There are a bunch of changes vs. Dual Shock 4 controllers from the PS4:- Far more shallow indentation on bottom for grip, means that you have a lot less to hold on to and must use much more strength to not slip around- Same shallowness and wider front-to-back width means that for people with large hands, the middle finger has nowhere to go and ends up either curled awkwardly or squished hard into the back surface- Sticks are about 1.5-2cm differently positioned vs. grips from the PS4 controller, so while the PS4 controller sticks just were right under your thumbs the moment you gripped them, the Dual Sense sticks are closer to your body and farther away from the grips inward as well, meaning to use them you have to stretch your thumb out and rearward toward your body at all times- Sticks are farther away from the buttons and d-pad meaning that in addition to having to extend your thumb weirdly to get over the sticks, you also have to move your thumbs much farther each time you reach for a button, then back again- Feedback on the front L/R triggers creates added resistance that leads to a kind of carpal tunnel style injury if you're using them a lot, since you have to press them a lot harder than you used to- Rear/bottom edges of the grips have hard angles, and for the person in the house whose pinky fingers sit off grip, this leads to bright red lines and huge soreness across their fingers after half an hour of play- The angle of the grips has changed meaning that your wrists are no longer straight as you play relative to your forearm, but are angled the entire time, again, carpal tunnel maker- Finally, the controllers are about twice as heavy as the PS4 controllers and this also adds up over timeBasically, we're torn. With no third-party PS5 controllers on the market and Sony blocking the use of PS4 controllers for PS5 games, we've basically ended up in a scenario where we're using the PS5 just to play PS4 games with the Dual Shock 4 controllers from the PS4, and rarely playing any actual PS5 games. So it hardly seems worth it to hang on to the PS5 when we already have a perfectly good PS4 around.POINT BEING: Before you choose a PS5, get your hands on a Dual Sense controller for the PS5 and play a game with it. Go to Best Buy or whatever and try it out for 15 minutes. If you have similar bones/muscles/whatever to ours, you will have pretty serious pain issues already starting in that span of time.Some people say the Dual Sense is the most comfortable controller they've used and I'm happy for them. The flipside is that this is the case for them because Sony has *seriously* changed the ergonomics and shape of its controllers with this generation—so don't go into this without testing first.The issues are serious enough to have us considering a move to the Xbox ecosystem.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV84G1BSWOIIN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","0","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

We changed HDMI cords, tried different televisions, and all settings were changed and there were still a bunch of pixels in places they shouldn't have been. Upon doing further research it appears the GPU is bad in this model. I am highly upset. I have to wait for them to receive my device before I get a refund, and not only that, I can't even get a replacement from a different seller because it's considered a high-demand item.

"12/25/2022","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Al A.","A major step up from a PS4 PRO (and previously, PS3)......faster and better graphics....","Short review!I'm not going to review the Amazon selection or delivery process. I'm just going to briefly review about why I upgraded to a PS5!First the negative....... my PRO was compact and reasonably designed in a flat symmetrical style......  The PS5 throws out the space saving rule book in favor of waves and advanced looking style and it'll not fit where your PS4 PRO was if it was in a tight space.Be aware that although the PS4 and PS4 PRO had 4K HDMI output for games, those PS4 models were limited to playing only 1080 Blu-Ray or regular definition DVDs.  The PS4 will not play 4K Blu-Ray disks. Why Sony left that feature out, who knows!  The good news is the PS5 DVD deck plays 4K movies to their full resolution. (as well of course as Blu-Ray 1080 and lower resolution/standard def DVDs). Now I only need my PS5 in the living room to cover it all rather then the 4K blu-ray player I had to use along with my PS4 PRO.I own several PS4 games and have yet to purchase any PS5 games.Let me say that my PS4 games play better on the PS5 then they did on the PS4 PRO. Graphics are superior, speed to access any menu or just in game play is much faster and these PS4 games take on a new and improved view on screen on my 65 4K hdtv!I can only imagine how great games specifically designed for the PS5 will be to view and play.My initial perspective on the PS5 compared to my PS4 PRO is that although the body design for the PS5 sacrifices space and fit for cosmetics...... the PS5 blows away my PS4 PRO (my PS4 PRO is using an upgraded 2 TB SSD for more capacity and much faster access/read speed than a spinning hard drive).....Speaking of SSDs and upgrades; the PS4 used the common SATA 2.5 internal SSD for upgrading capacity and speed. (But) The PS5 has a soldered in ~860GB internal SSD which can not be removed. Sony added one slot for expanding the hard drive capacity using rather a plug-in PCIe M.2 NVMe SSD over a conventional SATA connected hard drive. Thus, the PS5 allows you to not replace the original hard drive, but, to add an additional on-board SSD instead.Typically, the soldered-in or card type SSDs are a bit faster then using a SATA based protocol connection and given the PS5 requires a very fast solid state hard drive, they designed it so you install an additional PCIe type SSD over replacing just the single hard drive as it was done in the PS4.Be advised that (some) PS5 games take 2-3X more capacity then a PS4 game did. Perhaps why Sony designed the PS5 to add more capacity by using a second expansion slot rather then like the PS4 just having only one slot to use for the total capacity.Google PS5 SSD upgrades and there's much info out there regarding how many games you want to be able to store on the console and how large an upgrade you need to do accordingly!Everything on the PS5 is faster........everything......menu, access, games ...graphics are better in detail, clarity.......I could go on.The other thing the PS5 asks you to do when you first set it up is a complete setup for display for best gamma, brightness, contrast, color, etc......it takes you through a complete and easy set up to -maximize- the quality for display on your HDTV. It made a huge difference on my Samsung 65 inch 4K TV.5 Stars all around! Read the pro AND owner/user reviews on this new PS console. Yes, it is worth upgrading.The ps5 is a totally new and better gaming console. It's the first to be backward compatible with PS4 games, ...something my PS4 PRO would not allow for my PS3 games. So if you have a PS4 game collection, don't get rid of them!If you own a PS3, PS4 or PS4 PRO, yes, it is a worthwhile upgrade and substantial evolution for the PS Game Console series. You will not be sorry for upgrading and a big upgrade it will be!","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JEYZI9LJ3QFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","155","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

From someone who's tried them all the pc is the best... however when it comes to console the playstation is far superior in gaming and experience. Ever since the first start up to all the exclusive titles this console is unparalleled. I haven't touched my Xbox In a looong time. Today I'm experiencing all the playstation only things and can tell I'll be finding myself coming back for more the Xbox lacks that for me right now. The pc will always be homebound but this console is amazing... the duel sense controller feels soo good and adds a WHOLE new level of immersion to gaming it really makes and sounds like you're in the game. Only downfall is lack of Bluetooth support. Luckily my OLED display has Bluetooth capability so I can use my Sony xm4 earbuds.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NPewJXA5L._SY1600.jpg","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRTXSRHE711J7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","7","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

You get the best of both worlds with disc version.  You can buy physical games that come in a bundle package that have rare ps5 related items! Also if you buy digital games they have amazing deals on the PS store! Look around for the cheapest deal on games, it will save you a ton of money. I would recommend buying an additional memory booster. Some of these digital games are well over 100gbs! You will only have around 600gbs when you start off with a new ps5 I believe. Memory gets used up extremely fast! I also had a pleasant experience buying this from here. From me sending a request to purchase a ps5, I had an email invite like 2 days later plus only like 2 days to send it. So I received it extremely fast! I have heard of people waiting much longer though. This can also play most ps4 games as well. Also you can get a playstation plus membership for like $15 a month that allows you to play tons of ps5 and ps4 games. There is a lot of cool things to do with this ps5!! Highly recommend!!","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HGQKH45LPRRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","8","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

"12/21/2022","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Chad Young","Next Gen Gaming console","Full disclosure I have been looking for this since the PS5 was released. I wanted the disc version in order to upload/play PS4 games using the backward compatibility. But I was not going to pay more than MSRP for this. Had multiple opportunities to purchase one for $800 or more, but turned them down.With tax I paid a little over $600 for this console bundled with God of War: Ragnarok. That was a very fair deal.Graphics are amazing. I have it hooked to a 4K 120hz refresh LED TV and the picture is beautiful. Games load fast because of the internal SSD drive. Running the audio through a 700 watt 7.2 surround sound system, and the console allows you to customize those settings based on speaker placement. Audio is outstanding. Transferring data from my PS4 to the PS5 did take a little longer than expected, even on a gigabit network. I suspect that was due to the limits of the PS4 network card, but can't prove it one way or another. All in all, setup and transfer of data took about 4 hours.PS4 games run upscaled look great, but there is still a huge difference in the graphics for a PS5 release.The way Amazon did the sale via invite only was great. No trying to beat bots. Didn't have to worry about getting it in my cart and have it disappear when I submitted the payment. Amazon nailed this sale process.Sign up for the Amazon invite if you are still trying to get a PS5 and don't want to pay upcharges through other sellers or resellers. It was worth the wait.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HVQ82Z84ZS9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","22","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

So for the game first, so far amazing game from Sony, great graphics improvements and frame rate. The console overall is good, a bit big but very quiet. The controller feels great but I have been having issues with some latency or maybe is me playing bad and not getting use to yet to the controller. The haptic feedback is interesting and makes the immersion to some parts of the game cool. Since the controller has new features and sound the battery life is a bit short. Overall I love the bundle price and definitely recommend it if you can find one.

"12/21/2022","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Brian W. Britt","What are you wait for? If you get the invite, go for it.","Nothing else much to say other than Amazon sent me a invitation request for it on the 10th of December. And with the quickest hands in the west and the power of a credit card, snatched one up. Actually did get an invite for the regular one without the bundle not just once but twice, back in June and even further back during February. Skipped out though mainly because most of the games I cared for was multi-platform. But that's besides the point because as a lot of the futures games that I am eying are now making the jump towards this generation of hardware, PS5 Xbox Series X level, I figured I would go for it. Plus it came with  one of my most anticipated games so that was a big push.But yeah product wise, everything came as advertise: Console, kickstand, a controller, HDMI, USB C and a Power cord. On start up you have the option of copying over your data from the PS4 in terms of content, save data and games. It doesn't get rid of it, just a straight copy. I skipped this option though since I had most of my games on an external Hard drive. Fun fact is that you can change and share that same hard drive between the PS4 and PS5 and it will work vise versa as long as it's on the same account. So on the PS4 side, if you have a External Drives, makes it easy to store your PS4 games. And you want to save your PS4 games somewhere else because the main storage , although a good amount, can easily be filled.But yeah, very happy with my early personal Christmas Gift to myself and can't wait to check out more games with this nice SSD! Also the controller and its haptic feedback does make a subtle nice experience that you definitely have to feel. Sounds like a gimmick but it's completely in the background while adding to the experience.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+YFSYtA2L._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-XFxF6MLL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716lFn1tOoL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EsJn-5zqL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZexzUVP9L._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pAdJ-EidL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rmmrMcYPL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uDMlwEoKL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vcFAmlPAL._SY1600.jpg","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16Z737GQIHRL7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","36","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

"12/14/2022","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Mellow Customer","Patients is needed but Great Console","I waited for over 2 years to get my hands on a PS5. I did not want to pay those outrageous prices online from third party companies and so I waited until I receive my invitation to purchase.  I purchase it shortly after receiving my invitation and it came a week later. I wanted to use it right away and it drove me crazy every time I see please wait on the screen when it is importing files. When I finally got to use it,  I was impressed. I loved the haptic feature when using the controllers. You have never lived unless you feel the tension on the trigger button when shooting in Call of Duty. I also liked the remote play feature on PS5 which allows to play from pc or android devices. You can extend the useful life of that old PS4 by using remote play to play your PS5 in another room.

I’ve picked up two of these, but sold the first after finishing Forbidden West, because there were no more good exclusives available, and the console was just sitting around for months unused, as I also have PC and Xbox X.

"12/10/2022","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Brandon Kovash","Excellent Upgrade From The PS4! No physical copy of the game","I'll start off by saying that I really like this console so far! The menus are smooth, and the gameplay (at least on the included God of War: Ragnarok) is smooth and responsive.The setup of the console was easy, although I did need a small flat-head screwdriver in order to carefully pry out the screw-hole cap that you need to remove in order to screw the console into the vertical mount. After that, attaching the vertical mount to the console was a breeze and I really like the look of having the console standing upright. It also feels sturdy enough that Im not worried about it tipping over.The controller is a massive improvement to gaming controllers as a whole. The adaptive triggers alone can add an entirely different experience to playing a game. I haven't found this feature used very often in God of War yet, but the included Astros Playroom introduces this feature, and gives you some scenarios to play where this feature is showed-off a bit more, and it's really fun. It adds a new level of immersion that I wouldn't have even thought of to the controller. The haptic feedback vibrations are a nice feature as well. Having more intense and involved forms of vibrations from the controller helps with the immersion as well.The package I purchased came with the God of War: Ragnarok game and, like the description of the item (and other reviews) mention, it does have the digital version included. This is one of my biggest complaints, is that I wish that they had just gone with including the physical copy. Downloading the game wasn't too long of a process, but having the physical copy to have and collect would have been nice without having to purchase a separate physical copy (which I won't be doing myself). Especially for those who collect video games/manuals/etc.Overall, I'm glad to have gotten the opportunity to get this, considering all the shortages. It's been a fun time playing through the second chapter of the God of War franchise, and so far the experience has been great!","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YU8AMXDLO4AG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","36","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

I knew before as the description stated this, but still feel disappointed.Overall the console is silent, the gamepad is what I enjoyed the most with fast loading times but other than that the PS5 is still like a beta product after 2 years.

"12/05/2022","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Kyle","Great system with a couple","design flaws. The two major ones: 1) Lack of initial memory. You'll need to buy a second drive but those are easy to install and they are easy to find. 2) Whomever designed to Stand for the Ps5 needs to be fired. It is terrible and should be something else a person buys at the time of purchase. 3) <Personal choice but I didn't like the bright white cover and bought a replacement Midnight Black. BUT that is a personal preference.>------------------A couple of months later and things are still moving along great. One thing I HAVE to tell people - For the love of everything , do NOT place your Ps5 in an enclosed space . Give this thing room to breathe and receive air in order to keep it cool. Make SURE you are able to at least access it in order to clear it of dust every now and then. This console is a tank. It's big. It's bulky. And it needs space .  This thing is too valuable to risk blowing up because you store it in a cabinet ; simply because it looks neat.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R349VPW30NUIH1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","13","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

"12/03/2022","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Abdel","So far a great experience","This is truly a next gen-console, compared to the ps4 the ps5 is an upgrade in every conceivable way, but maybe just maybe the design is bit of a letdown. And like any great piece of tech it has some flaws(beside the design), I have experienced this on the first day of using it. There are certain apps that do not work, perhaps do to software bugs that in my opinion add a bit of human error into something that would have otherwise been perfect. Though, I wager Sony will do something about that eventually. Overall, I think this console is worth the purchase and I recommend. One last thing. If you have a ton of games you would be wise to purchase a storage expansion, the available storage on the ps5 runs out quite quickly.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D8X2VC27WP78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","21","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

Highly recommend.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C6S61S4JR794/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BHC395WW","0","B0BHC395WW","Edition: Disc"

Upon setting up, suprised how quite it is compared to the regular ps4/ps4 pro (jet engine edition). As well as suprised that ps4 games just work great out of the box. Loading times are alot faster as well compared to my ps4 that I swapped in a ssd with. The god of war game is a digital code, which is a downside given how techincally your paying for the game just 10 dollars cheaper than the standalone (stop being cheap sony). Good thing though is it a 1200 model (CFI-1215A) if anyone is wondering. Overall I'm happy with my purchase and how fast amazon sent the invite link, but if you can get the ps5 without the game bundle i'd get that.
