03/19/2023,United States,3,Emily,Light weight and portable,"Great for on the go. I have a Graco stroller which is super heavy, but maneuvers much easier. This one sometimes seems to want to steer a different direction (may be just due to it being so light weight). I also feel like if at a park or somewhere outdoors, it’s not as smooth of a ride. You can definitely feel rolling over pebbles or sticks a lot. Also we do not find it to be a “one-handed folding” stroller. It’s kind of a pain to unfold. The cup holders at the top for parents are also really small—it will fit a water bottle but not my travel coffee mug—and the tray barely fits my phone. Overall, decent value for the price and again, it accomplishes the job of being a portable stroller for quick trips to the grocery store or mall.

10/28/2022,United States,4,Jennifer R Heuertz,Nice lightweight stroller,"I had been using a different umbrella stroller that was a real hassle to collapse, didn't store upright, and was kind of heavy. I wanted something lightweight, easy to collapse, and that folded flat, but stood up so I didn't have to bend down to get it. This stroller definitely fits the bill! It's very light, and while it takes a bit of finesse with the latch on the handle, it collapses with one hand. It will then stand upright and folded, and takes up less space. It has a tray, which is really great, and has come in handy a lot, but the bummer is that it doesn't come off. It does have a reclining seat, but at it's tightest, it is still fairly tilted back, so my son is never quite upright. He doesn't seem to mind most of the time. The storage basket is a decent size, and there are two cupholders and a phone holder in the handle, as well as a cupholder in the tray. The padding is already starting to tear on the handles, but the price was so good, I don't really care.

09/17/2022,United States,5,NSV,BUY IT!,"I'm not going to lie, this was a 2am impulse buy. We were using a stroller caddy up until we got a convertible carseat so a new stroller was a need. The stroller arrived this morning and I assembled as soon as it was dropped off, took me maybe 20 minutes and was easy! I'm a follow by the manual type girl.The cons I saw most people mention was the cup holders and how the wheels were wonky while closing. As far as the cup holders, the cup my child is holding fits in his cup holder with no issues. As far as the parent cup holders, considering I went from a stroller caddy and I got in the habit of tossing my water bottle in the storage basket and I will probably do the same while using this stroller. In the manual it explains exactly how to close the stroller properly and since I went by the book, I had no issues.We took a couple laps through the house and we have no complaints. My child was just a kicking his legs and smiling because he has view of everything now and loves it!I love how it's not bulky and lightweight too!

09/11/2022,United States,5,Laura Zwart,"Light weight, lots of shade.","We bought this stroller for our Disney vacation. All we had was a crappy hand-me-down umbrella stroller so this was a nice affordable upgrade. It has lots of pros and cons. I overall love it because it’s crazy lightweight and stands up on its own while closed. It’s very easy to move around and has cup holders for everyone and a snack tray. My son can easily climb in and out of it with the tray on but the tray also easily comes off. It has a decent recline for sleepy kids and lastly it has really good shade cover which was the biggest reason I bought it. Now for the cons, yes, it has a 5 point harness but I don’t totally love the hardware they used. However, it works well enough so we’ll just call it meh. The shade cover when fully pulled back kind of gets in the way of the drink holders but we’ll usually have it down so I’m not super worried. I wish the cup holders were a bit bigger especially for the child tray as his 360 doesn’t fit well in there. Lastly, we have NOT found this to be an easy one handed open and close. At minimum you need to add a foot to help it out. I think it’s something about the wheels not lining up right that makes it a little clunky when trying to close it. Also weird note, you have to use the locking piece on the side and the stroller actually folds up tighter than the locking mechanism allows. I found that odd.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ1WXGO30PLLD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,13,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)
09/08/2022,United States,2,Char,Very wobbly,"I read really good reviews about this stroller which made me pick it. I will start by saying I am a little bit of a stroller snob and maybe my expectations were pretty high because I have the Uppababy Vista which I love!! Wanted something more lightweight and compact to take to Disney for my 5 month old but could still be big enough to fit my 6 yr old if his legs got tired and he needed a break. It was quick and easy to put together, however the stroller was very wobbly. Almost like the wheels would pop off. I had my husband check it out to make sure everything was tight and even after his check it was still wobbly. It didn’t feel sturdy enough to travel with through the airport. With only 1 day left until vacay I went to Walmart and found the Evenflo Reversi for $20 more. For the price I love the reversi! Very light weight, much easier to close, felt sturdy and ended up pushing my 6 yr old in it through the airport because our 5:30am flight was just too early for him. The Kolcroft was extremely difficult to close. I actually didn’t have enough strength to close it and the basket isn’t as big as it looks especially compared to my vista. The reversi basket was much bigger. I really did want to love this stroller.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R90LRC57ZSIZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,0,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)

I’m a first time mom, so I previously purchased a stroller that came with the combo of baby car seat & then toddler stroller seating. It was great, but very bulky and heavy. If you have a young toddler and you like going out to theme parks or brief outings, this lightweight stroller is a must!Pros: it’s light weight, doesn’t take up too much space in your trunk, folds easily, the umbrella cover is actually big enough to provide shade, has a tray to give your child snacks.Cons: the storage is minimal (just something to keep in mind), the cup holder for child is small and our cup didn’t fit. It barely fit on the adult holder at the top, it says it has shocks, but as we traveled through a semi-rocky path, it was bumpier than our older stroller.Personally, I feel the pros outweigh the cons for me.

08/02/2022,United States,1,Ace007,Primarily an indoor mall stroller,So many positive reviews about this stroller baffles my mind. I feel compelled to list every con about this item in hopes of other people not wasting their time or money.1. The stroller is way too light. I am actually afraid it will tip over. Maneuvering it is actually scary.2. The stroller is built way too low. If you are a person 5 1/2 feet or above you will feel very awkward maneuvering this thing as it is that low.3. The top peek a boo window has no flapIs no one concerned with the lack of a flap on the peek a boo window? I mean seriously how much more thought could it have taken to put one one? Did the manufacturer even think about the hot sun beaming on my child’s head? Seriously can anyone please give me an explanation as to how something so simple as a cover could have been overlooked?4. The wheels feel like styraphome. No way will they hold up being utilized outdoors.5. The back rest is made out of a simple piece of cardboard.6. The front tray cup holder is smaller than the parent ones. My baby’s bottle would not fit in it.7. The front is designed so that when my baby drops her bottle or whatever she may have it will fall to the ground. This is a problem most strollers have and can be corrected with a simple plastic basket.8. The soft handgrips make my hands sweat unlike the rubber coating of my big stroller.9. The back breaks have to be set on both wheels unlike my bigger stroller where one click locks both sides.I can go on and on but I’m going to summit up in just three simple words DON’T BUY IT!,,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L5Z3UC6LRIDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,0,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

07/21/2022,United States,1,NH,"Tiny cup holders, not correct weight limit","This stroller is terrible! My daughter weighs 35 lbs and we can barely push it with her in it. The weight limit says 50 lbs, so I’m thinking they need to lower the weight limit. The wheels squeak the entire time we’re pushing it, and it’s so hard to turn when she’s in it. It’s easy to fold up, but the flimsy latch that is supposed to keep it folded falls off the bar constantly and the stroller comes unfolded. The main reason I bought this stroller was for the parent cup holders/tray and the child cup holder/tray, but if you plan to drink anything bigger than a bottle of water, the holes will be too tiny and you won’t be able to use them. Same goes for the kid cup holder- none of my daughter’s sippy cups can fit in the hole so they’re constantly falling on the ground as we walk because she has to leave it on the tray. The adult tray is also too small to hold my phone.

The terrain we used it on for 2.5 weeks was NOT easy, and this thing dominated everywhere we took it. Very rough cobblestones, gravel roads, dirt paths, grass, streets, etc. Nothing could bring it down! We were completely impressed by the end of our trip. Not to mention the storage basket in the bottom is very spacious, the snack tray is clutch for eating on the go, and it's SO LIGHTWEIGHT!

He is 2 and I felt he was too big for a stroller but we desperately needed one to help make our outings a bit easier and faster. After looking at the reviews, I felt like he would fit comfortably in this one. It's lightweight and doesn't take up space in a car trunk at all. My son fits perfectly in it now, though he might grow out of it soon. Perhaps by the time he is 3 but for right now, it's very helpful. My only concerns are that it can't be adjusted for his head to lay back as much as I would like but that's minor. Also, it says easy 1 hand fold but for me, it's a bit tricky. I think I need some practice lol Regardless, it is serving its purpose. Wheels work fine and the tray is good for snacks. Cupholders are small, in my opinion.

Not many frills, but it does have a cupholder for the adult, a tray for the child, and the under-seat storage which is key! My one con is that it doesn't click and lock closed when you fold it up. There is only a red latch you can fold down to help the stroller stay shut. This latch comes undone easily and makes it a bit more of a hassle to load in and out of the trunk of our car.

05/18/2022,United States,4,CES Penname,"Looks Good, HOWEVER, Despite Being Renewed by Amazon""...NO Instructions?!?""","Updated:- Purchased as a lightweight stroller with respectable suspension for taking my grandchild out on walks along the rough graveled paths at local parks.- First impression: It definitely seems to fulfill those requirements.- It arrived on time. I did purchase it as an Open Box product, but the online assessment stated it was in Very Good condition. All the parts _seem_ to have been included and there was no obvious damage to any of them. However, there were no basic assembly instructions or even a parts list, so how could any customer know for sure?- This stroller was supposed to be Renewed by Amazon. I don't think it's too much to presume that care would be taken to assure the safety of a _baby_ stroller by making certain it could be assembled correctly with all safety features properly engaged. Even if it was returned without the instructions; it seems like it should not have been that difficult for the renewal team to notice those instructions were missing, and print them out from the manufacturer to include as part of the promised (right there on the box!) Renewed by Amazon. Just sayin'.- Ultimately, I was able to assemble it in fairly short order and everything seems to be functioning the way it should. Still, I do think it's a good thing there weren't that many parts to puzzle over. The one-handed fold is a little trickier to master, but folding it is not at all difficult with two hands. And it does indeed stand up on its own when folded on a level surface - and easily stores in my coat closet. Both the Amazon page and the box state it has ..all-terrain wheels with front suspension - and after my 8-month-old grandchild took a ride in it over a fairly uneven forest path and fell asleep along the way, I'd say that's definitely the best testament to that feature and the overall comfort of the stroller.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSCBLO4BREC6H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,8,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)

The canopy is nice.Cons: it is very particular with the way the wheels need to face when folding, otherwise it doesn't fold flat. I can not get mine to stand upright when folded consistently. The maneuverability is TERRIBLE, turning is a nightmare, again I blame the wheels. Tiny parent tray and cupholders, none will fit any of her sippy cups. Feels almost flimsy, but hey, lightweight.

To recline to seat, you have to use the old school pull/release but it’s easy to use and not a huge deal. The storage underneath is smaller but can hold a diaper bag and a backpack.

04/09/2022,United States,5,"Sure, Not",Indestructible,"We bought this stroller when my son was about 6 months old. We live in Florida and wanted something with good airflow. We are also theme park junkies and are in a theme park just about every weekend. This beast has spent just about every weekend at SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Universal, Aquatica or Volcano Bay with the occasional trip to the Tampa Zoo. My son has slept in it, eaten in it, laughed in it and zoomed from ride to ride, show to show. Just the other day, while getting it out in Universal's parking lot, it dawned on me, we paid roughly $65 for this thing and it has been a trooper. We did the (admittedly rough) math and based on our typical phone reading and a solid guess on how many days this thing has been in a theme park, it's got about 2,000 miles of wear on it with no signs of slowing down. Sure it's a bit faded from the sun, and it has every stain known to childhood all over it, but man if you told me that a sub $100 stroller would last 5 years getting straight beat up at theme parks and just keep on ticking, I wouldn't believe you. Anyway, we don't even call it the stroller anymore.

This stroller was wonderful.It was easy to put together. I was able to assemble all the pieces while my kiddo ate breakfast.It's easy to adjust the straps.The basket underneath can hold a bunch of stuff (I kept kiddo's shoes, a jacket, a blanket, and a hoodie for myself under there).It collapses pretty easily after you give it a couple practice runs. It also doesn't take up much space. ANNNDDD it will stand up once collapsed.It maneuvers so well. We took this stroller to zoos, aquariums, museums, and walked around a city. It's small enough to not be annoying, but big enough that my kiddo doesn't feel cramped.The only cons I have regarding this stroller is the canopy is kind of flimsy and a decent weighted diaper bag can't hang off the stroller handles without flipping the stroller. Neither one of those was a deal breaker for me.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LH48695P7JS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,2,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)

03/07/2022,United States,4,Katie,A great light weight stroller,"We desperately needed a new stroller for my 3.5 year old, our heavily used Chicco Bravo stroller didn't have much life left. Since she is almost 4 I really didn't want to spend a lot of money on a stroller, but also wanted something more than an umbrella stroller. After looking at many many options I decided to go with this one, mostly because the seat looked deeper than the other options I looked at and my daughter is very tall. We got it today and it was very easy to put together. The wheels are very durable feeling, like a rubbery plastic. The seat recline is adjustable from a strap in the back. The snack tray is nice, cupholder fits nuk sippy cups but Zak water bottles are too big. My daughter is 3'5 tall and she has plenty of leg room still with the foot rest. When we took it around our neighborhood, the wheels worked great making it smoothly over large cracks and bumps in the sidewalk, and over curbs. It's a good deal for what you get, not sure how long lasting it will be though. The only downside is the hip straps are pretty difficult to adjust, also the basket storage has no closure toward the footrest so it is possible things could fall out of the front. Overall I would reccomend it to others.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81EZai5oGLL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81P8L1MFJfL._SY1600.jpg",,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VHP60YQCJHIT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,30,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)

REVIEWS are Misleading!!!,My title is understandably an oxymoron but many users like me buy products based on reviews and this was clearly a mistake. The issues with this stroller are:- low quality wheels which get worn out super fast more so if you use in areas where there is snow and salt. They can not go through even based snow layers.- foot rest is very poorly designed so the baby can never get to keep feet on them and hence will remain hanging and it's not because of the height of the baby.- the back support is poor and baby can't be kept for more than an hour - they still start getting pain- the straps are the worst - they can't be adjusted for lengthy without a long battle of playing with the stupid loop. Do they even test their design before production???All in all it was the worst 75+$ that i spent and it's surprising that how people actually have good reviews to this total disaster of engineering,,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1K8035BYIWV4P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,0,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)

01/04/2022,United States,3,Chris and Amanda Miller,Does not work for bigger kid,"I am writing this review because I could not find any with this information when I was looking. I got this for my almost 4 year old to take to Disney. We already have a stroller that she is almost grown out of and I wanted a new one that moves easier and she had more room in. When I looked this had great reviews, the weight limit was enough and she would be able to fit. Now, she did fit in it. She is about 40lbs and 42inches tall. It does move very well with her in it. It folds easily and compactly. But I had some problems with it.While she does fit, her head touches the cover, her feet have nowhere to comfortably go since her legs are longer and when she dangles them they hit the wheels and make it hard to move. It sits lower to the ground which makes the handles lower and can be annoying for taller people having to hunch over. The cup holders would have been great except that none of her cups fit in her tray and the tray didnt swivel so it would have to be completely removed for her to comfortably get in and out. The parent tray also did not fit any of my cups and is really only useful for plastic water bottles but I usually carry refillable bottles.In comparison I already own a Urbini Reversi Stroller that we got when she had just turned 1. She is pushing the weight limit on this one which makes pushing it a bit harder but the benefits of it over the new one are that its higher off the ground with a longer seat giving her feet somewhere to go other than in front of the wheels. The much larger canopy is very nice, she does fit in it length wise even though shes getting too heavy for it. The storage on the bottom is also bigger and 'easier' to access which says alot because its storage has been annoying since I got it.I just wanted to add this review for the parents looking for something for a bigger kid. I would recommend something different because this just wasnt it.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1J509ELL21BRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,1,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)

It has no stability and whatever you put in it, it almost touches the ground. It also has no front netting on the storage by the kids foot rest and anything can easily slide out. The kids tray has no clasp/clip to easily take off for them to quickly go in and out as they please. The whole tray must be taken off. As far as stability of the stroller, it feels and looks very cheap. The “springs” on the front wheels are strictly only for looks, it’s a cheap piece of plastic that covers the metal underneath. I feel like I have no control when pushing the stroller and it is just all over the place.

My son is a small child relative to other children and he didn't fit well in the seat. He actually seemed too big for it. Also the adjustability of the seat back is a bit awkward since its done with straps. A big inconvenience are cup holders. None of them seem to be made for adult sized cups/ water bottles, and only seem to be sized for baby bottles. Sippy cups we had didn't even fit. The materials of the stroller were of good construction, it was lightweight, and easy to push and maneuver. The reason I marked the folding so low was mainly due to it staying folded. There is a latch that is used to keep the stroller folded. However, it does not stay. So, as you pick up the stroller to put it away, the stroller starts to unfold making it very difficult to manage.

09/22/2021,United States,4,Morgan,Decent travel stroller,"Purchased this to keep in my car and use as an every day/errand stroller. Fits fine in my trunk and I can still fit groceries and anything else with it. Opens easily. Like the storage basket on the bottom. The shade is great, big enough to keep the sun out really well. It’s lightweight and easy to get in and out of the car. Folding it up can be difficult- as other reviews stated, I have to roll it backwards to get the wheels facing the correct direction for it to fold up completely, and if I’m holding my son when I do this it’s pretty hard because as soon as you try to push the stroller into a fold it wants to obviously move forward which turns the wheels again. Definitely not a one hand fold up for me. The tray for the top I have had pop off several times, not a huge deal for me. Honestly my biggest beef with this stroller is that the part of the buckle that goes between my sons legs is so long and not adjustable. I have to keep the sides very tight to try to keep the bottom buckle part completely extended otherwise he slides down super far even in an upright position. He still slides down a little bit but he’s usually not in this stroller for really long periods so it’s okay. I hadn’t seen that mentioned in the reviews I read and if I had known this before I would have gone with a different stroller for this reason. But it’s a decent stroller for the price and works fine for what we need it for.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBR2VERXCEJA3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,2,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)

The stroller does not recline enough for a tired baby or toddler to be able to sleep (halfway comfortably), wheels are a cheap plastic of sorts, very little to no shading and uncomfortable as little to no padding. It IS very lightweight though! That’s the only thing going for it. Already started the return process but what a hassle to have to take it all apart and get it back in the box. Thankfully free returns and dropping at UPS is easy. Have decided to use my son’s old stroller (her daddy) that’s a 34 yo Graco, and worked well for me with 2 boys.

09/03/2021,United States,5,Dina Stremel,Airport approved,"Bought this for our long air travel with several connections. This stroller was a life saver as we literally had to run at some points. Our 3yo is the average size of 5.5yo, so she’s very big and still fit pretty good in it. It folds very good and slim enough in order to go through the security belts. Heads up if your stroller is too big for the security belt scanner, they will need to manually inspect it and that takes longer time, so the fact that this goes through made a huge difference. We haven’t perfected folding and unfolding it and the manual had absolutely no information on how to do it (go figure). Another thing I noticed is that the seat is somewhat stiff surface so when my kid sat in she didn’t sink in. This was better for keeping her long legs still at a manageable height off the ground. This stroller’s overall clearance off the ground is higher than other lightweight and umbrella strollers. We had a connection in Vienna and I noticed that they had strollers that you can borrow, and they were this exact same kind, but just different color and without logos.

It glides along smoothly, has a easy on easy off snack tray for child, and good size basket for a light weight stroller. It does lack in a couple of things such as the material of the seat is a cheaper quality then my other brands of strollers (I have had 7 strollers with my 3 kids), the parent tray doesn’t fit many beverage cup sizes, the child snack tray doesn’t fit many of the different sizes of sippy cups either (it does fit the Walmart cup for $1).

07/21/2021,United States,3,Kidd,Good Enough,"We bought this stroller for our two and a half year old because we needed something light weight while traveling that would accommodate her size. About 30 lbs and a almost 3 feet I suppose. (I haven’t measured her in a while). Anyway, she fit it well but was too long for the stroller (she’s a tall kid somehow - I’m short. Her dad is a head above me) so we had to keep reminding her to put her feet on the foot rest while in motion. Everything worked out but it was well-worn with just an 8 day trip. The cloth was fine and the structural integrity showed use. The wheels were somewhat compromised by the time we got back but they still roll. We gate checked it at the airport to take the load off the little one until boarding. It fit well in our rental. It was easy to fold and stow away in a large travel bag. The storage compartment on the bottom is small. It didn’t really lock in place without effort. And the cup holder did not hold her toddler water bottles although they did accommodate regular size plastic water bottles you get from most any store.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RI5UJ0NCO9R1R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,1,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

05/29/2021,United States,2,TeacherTonya,You get what you pay for,"I've had this stroller a few months now. It is just OK. It does fold up relatively easily, as compared to my last stroller. It is also lightweight. It folds up much bigger than I expected. It feels very cheaply made. I bought it because I liked that it had a place for me to put my phone and the undercarriage was easily accessible, all of which are true. The undercarriage is also accessible from the front, which I don't really like. You could place something there and it could roll out the front. To lift or lower the back of the seat, you just tighten or loosen a strap. It doesn't provide much support for my little one, who looks very uncomfortable in it. The thing I dislike most is that there is nothing between the legs from the tray to the seat. Unless you hook your child in using the seat belt, they can easily fall through. I wouldn't suggest this as a long-term stroller. Already shopping for my next one.Update 12/2021My disdain for this stroller has slowly increased with time. The biggest thing that I'm not liking now is the angle of the back. My little one looks so uncomfortable! There is a little strap to raise and lower the back, but it doesn't go down enough for her to take a nap comfortably, and all the way up isn't comfortable to sit.

05/15/2021,United States,2,DeAnn S,Difficult to fold,"This stroller is a royal pain to fold and unfold. The hype that it it has “convenient one-hand fold” is patently false. Folding absolutely does require two hands and is difficult even then. First, you have to slide a button sideways and, while holding it, use your other hand to depress a lever. As you do that, the sunshade support will snap back and smack your fingers if you’re not careful. Next, as you reach down and forward to bring the seat up and back while keeping the lever depressed, you won’t find anything to easily grab. There should be a metal bar below and parallel to the seat front; instead, you have to fumble with the seat’s diagonal side supports. After all that, the thing won’t fold more than 2/3 of the way unless you lean down and use your hand to physically rotate the front wheels such that they nest into the rear wheels. It’s gross to have to touch the wheel treads that have been rolling through who knows what. I’m sending this stroller back. I’ll be avoiding the Kolcraft brand from now on because of this product’s poor design and the company’s misleading advertising.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38F6S1KITWV6B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,0,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)

The harness restraint is easily detachable, but it is sewn in, so I guess your child has no choice but to have the clips dig into their back. (Would’ve been nice if you could completely remove them for toddlers)5. Basket underneath will be able to store quite a bit of stuff6. Buttons on the handle are easily pushed to collapse (I’ve had a couple strollers over the years where the buttons either didn’t work or were difficult to squeeze)Cons:***#1: why I may send this back, because the cup holders aren’t big enough to hold anything!! (For parents) Not a coffee tumbler, not a Yeti, none of my water bottles. Also, none of my daughters cups (she has 6 different kinds designed for toddlers) fit in the child’s cup holders.2. It’s not terribly difficult to fold, but if the front wheels aren’t facing the right way, then it won’t collapse all the way.

It is very cheaply made and I have never had to put so many parts together on a stroller before. I'm use to just having to snap wheels on and call it a day. This one, you practically build it all, piece by piece, except the frame. I'm only 5'4 and the handle is too short for me. It also does not handle well, it's hard to steer and the wheels constantly get stuck. The latch to lock it close doesn't align with the bar to latch it onto. The front wheels ALWAYS get in the way whenever I fold it. The seat is extremely thin and flimsy. You can lower the back of the seat a bit with the strap in the back but norther how high or low you adjust the back to, your kid will literally slip right out if you don't buckle them in.

I guess it is like they say, You get what you pay for...It has to be lightweight and easy to fold because most of the time you have tonthrow it over your shoulder and carry it plus your child due to no maneuverability! The maneuvering is horrendous. You can not steer with two hands let alone one and the wheels are so cheaply made they go over nothing, even those little cracks in the sidewalk trip this piece up. It is a terrible product. I have never written such a scathing review but this was so annoying to push my nephew in- it was as if the product was never tested with a child inside it.

The breaks are impossible to take off if you are in sandals/flip flops and the latch for locking the stroller when folded isnt positioned well.

She’s harnessed in, yet still slides and because there is no comfort guard for the harness buckles, it just digs into her diaper causing a wedgie-like situation.

09/20/2020,United States,5,Tracy,Great little stroller,"**UPDATE: I changed the review to 5 stars. I still really like this stroller and I use it almost every day out in my back yard. I've used it on regular walks, at the store, and as i said, the boardwalk, along with my yard and in my stone driveway. It maneuvers just fine and has held up great, though I don't abuse my strollers. I don't really fold this up much anymore because I use it daily, so the fact that I can't fold it one handed just is so minor for me. Still completely recommend this stroller.So far I have only used this twice and I love it. Its exactly what I wanted. I wanted it because its more than an umbrella stroller but not a heavy full size stroller. Its very light weight and folds pretty compact, easy to fit in any trunk or back seat. Other reviews said that this stroller was hard to maneuver and was very hard hitting on any kind of bump even the tiny cracks in the sidewalk. I have not experienced this issue whatsoever. We used it on the boardwalk and I also pushed it around my yard today in my stone driveway and in the grass and it did perfectly fine. Some said their kids were being jolted forward at every bump, again we have not experienced this at all on either terrain type. The basket is big enough to throw in a sweatshirt or 2 and small diaper bag or purse and some toys. Thats what I wanted. The only thing I had to knock some stars off for was the ease of folding. Could be because its brand new that its just stiff, but i am unable to fold it one handed with ease. I have to lift up on the child tray often to get it to close and the wheels don't always fall into position to provide a full fold without manually turning them. It is however, easy to unfold one handed so this issue is definitely minor, at least for us. Overall I completely recommend this stroller.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LL3P0YEAMQMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,8,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

There is no true upright position, and my 18 mo old grand daughter is way too reclined even on the highest setting for the seat.

Very easy to open and close - in fact I can do it with one hand while holding him with the other. It's very light and I can easily lift it in and out of the car trunk.It's much easier for me to maneuver than his full-sized stroller and I've had no trouble pushing it, even on short gravel pathways. My only complaint is the cup holders are too small (diameter) to hold any of my cups. They're more sized to fit a slim water bottle, but there is plenty of room in the basket for a purse, diaper bag, etc. Very happy with this purchase.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JS566UN8CZFL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,0,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)
08/11/2020,United States,3,Frank,Stroller is Okay. Good buy if you are on a budget. Not comfortable for Baby.,"I love the idea that this stroller is lightweight. I also love the idea that it is a cost effective alternative to the more expensive strollers. The one drawback, and the reason that this stroller doesn't cost more is the fact that it is not comfortable for babies. Babies cannot sit upright with support to their backs. For laying down or laying back, the stroller is fine, but sitting upright is a problem. Baby is going to be uncomfortable sitting upright.Other than that, the stroller is fine.

I am a therapist and have experiencing measuring wheelchairs and regular chairs for patients. The way the stroller is made there isn't enough room for her to sit back properly there is minimal space between the back and the edge of stroller.3rd con is the recline the description states it reclines but barely and the hard plastic piece on the inside I removed.PROS: As far as easy maneuverability and easy fold A+ and it is lightweight to push one handed.

My daughter (she’s almost 2) seems to really like it. It also shields her eyes from the sun far better than more expensive strollers I have had. I bought her a new one simply because I let a friend borrow the stroller I had and it was brought back to me in horrible condition. *sigh* I’m 5”3 and it is perfect for my height. Two complaints that I do have is the bottom basket a bit smaller than I’m used to and it’s a pretty tight fit for my diaper bag.

On our big stroller it's controlled by a squeezed lever and this stroller has a looped bracket that can be difficult to use when the kid is in the stroller-especially when sleep! Also, seat didn't recline far enough back so when she fell asleep she didn't look comfortable at all.

03/03/2020,United States,5,Chelle,It does what it says it will do.,"I have a 2 year old an 9 month old and I’m due in a month with our third. I am 5’1 and it’s hard for me to maneuver double strollers. So my family does single strollers and baby wearing. I wanted something just between our big grace single stroller and an umbrella stroller for walks and airports and other events and activities. This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. It isn’t nearly as easy to collapse as I would like but I imagine with time it will get easier.I assembled this by myself with a toddler and an infant crawling all over it while 27 weeks pregnant with more stress from the children than the stroller, which was all things very easy to put together.It is light weight - lighter than my Graco but as you would expect heavier than an umbrella. The tray in the front has been put to good use. We pour gold fish or crackers or other snacks on it for my toddler to munch on while we stroll but the little cup holder is tiny. My daughter primarily drinks from camelbak water bottles and that won’t fit in the tiny circumference of the cup holder on the tray so we just tuck her water by her hip and fill the cup thing with another snack. 😂My biggest complaint is the adult cup tray. It also has tiny little holders. An 80 cent plastic water will fit in there but that’s about it. No worries from me though when we got our first stroller I hated that tray too so I went and found a different one in amazon that I just love. I’ll be switching this one out for that as well.Overall I dig this thing.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RINRFBVQJWVPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,4,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

And there’s no good place to hang the diaper bag where it won’t tip the stroller over.Pros: I like the tray. It’s light, easy to fold, and fairly easy to put together.

01/23/2020,United States,4,Jasmine Halili,"NOT one handed fold and lock! Nice lightweight stroller, but disappointing","This stroller had such good reviews, especially as a one handed fold stroller to take to disneyland, so I was pretty disappointed when it proved that it wasnt really a good one handed fold stroller, as folding it down takes some good leverage or 2 hands, and you then still need 2 hands to fold a little strap thing over to lock it closed, which was also disappointing too as it has to be slightly open, not fully folded shut, to lock in place, and so if it get closed a little more for any reason the lock slips right off... I definitely did NOT like the locking mechanism... it was a nice lightweight stroller though for the cost if you dont mind those things... I did though and ended up returning it and getting the chicco mini bravo plus, which is a bit more expensive but so worth it! It has a true one handed fold and stays shut without any other little lock stuff! It worked great for taking my 1 and half year old to disneyland!

10/19/2019,United States,5,Kelsey,Served its purpose well,"We bought this stroller to use in the airport as well as out and about on vacation. It has an ample sun shade, the tray is great for restaurants, the wheels held up well, and it was surprisingly maneuverable.

This stroller was perfect for the airport, and it held up through 4 flights being gatechecked (in a bag) and a week of heavy use on vacation. The only downsides are the cupholders are too small for big bottles but do fit smaller kids cups, and the folding feature requires one hand on the handle as well as upward force on the tray to fully fold, requiring another hand or foot to do that, and the locking mechanism prevents it from folding in the most condensed form (does not fold up small like an umbrella stroller).

08/16/2019,United States,1,Amazon Customer,"Looks Great, Operates Poorly","I bought this as an alternative to an Umbrella Stroller for additional storage.... BIG mistake.And while this stroller looks GREAT in pictures and descriptions, HOWEVER--- it is very cheaply made.The wheels are squeaky and not durable--we bump a corner and it completely dented--they were wobbly and looked like they were going to fall off.The part that supports the back of child, only goes up so far--so the angle at which your child is sitting (more like laying) is extremely awkward---which normally would be okay if the harness part would keep them up, but ieven that is a thin strap and an annoying buckle that doesn't secure the child very well---poor boy's man bits we coming out of his diaper and shorts......The part where the child would be able to put their feet for added support, is sloped at an angle that makes it impossible for the feet to lay on, and it's not secure.....Basically, my child looked like a big blob of ooze who couldn't hold himself up and was falling out of the side.Folding this thing---was a NIGHTMARE---the concept is great--the practice, not so much....and the thing that locks it, doesn't even line up with the bar to lock it. And unfolding it is annoying, especially when you have a toddler in your other arm--- you have to use both hands and a leg to get this thing to lock into place...Just don't buy it.... it's a complete waste of money because you're just going to have to buy a different one...",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVWQYC37RW65Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,4,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)

Also, it has a good storage bin at the bottom. It seems nicely made and durable. My son loves going in and out of it. The latch is easy to press with one hand to fold, but the way the wheels align sometimes it is hard to fold completely down. Im hoping after using it a few more times I’ll figure it out. I also wish we were able to change the height of the handle. I’m short and my husband is tall, so being able to adjust it would have been great. Also it’s nice that the back can go up or down, so if the baby is sleeping it can be in reclining position. The problem is that you have to use two hands to adjust the strap.

The features that set this one apart from some of the others for me were the tray for eating (not sure why you wouldn't want one--it's removable if you don't need it), cup holders for baby and parents, extended sun shade (practically a necessity in Florida), and the ability to recline seat or sit up straight.The two very minor issues I could mention are that the cup holders are small (larger cups and sippies won't fit) and there are two tabs to set the break instead of one like our large stroller.

It's also narrower than a regular stroller so it fits through aisles at the store better then the big bulky ones.

While it serves its purpose as a fairly light stroller, which makes it great for travel. there are several downsides. It is definitely not as easy to fold as described. It requires two hands and at times manipulation of the front wheels in order for it to close completely. When it does, the lock does not attach properly and the basket frame touches the floor. The cup holders are very small and will not hold my daughters sippy cups. The basket storage is ok. Don’t plan on fitting a diaper bag. The material is extremely difficult to keep clean.

05/13/2019,United States,4,Alicia M. Austin,"It's great, but the cupholders are weird","To preface this, I am accustomed to a behemoth of a jogging stroller with regular/big cupholders. We bought this stroller to take to Disneyworld.Pros: This stroller is SO LIGHT and it folds SO EASILY. It has a one-hand folding system which is really helpful when you're short on hands. The seatback reclines. It has a five point seatbelt for those kids that won't stay in the seat AND the shoulder straps hook into the bottom clips, so you don't have to completely unbuckle your kid to release the shoulder straps. The sun shade actually extends further down than I was expecting, which is a nice bonus.Cons: Because it's super light, it can be difficult to lock the brakes without a child or something heavy in the seat - the whole stroller tips if you aren't paying attention. Because it's a compact stroller, the storage basket beneath it is smaller and can hold a small backpack. In my opinion, those negatives are minor because the trade-off is a lightweight stroller.The only major issue I have with this stroller is the cupholders - I have no idea why they were designed the way that they were, but they don't fit most cups. My Yeti is 2 3/4 inches at the bottom and it doesn't fit into the cupholder because the cupholder is not a true circle. It was designed with an indent in the cupholder which makes it more of a waxing moon shape instead of a circle. This is annoying because, while water bottles and smaller cups/bottles (like 20oz pop bottles, paper/flexible plastic takeout cups, etc) will fit in the cupholders, the regular-sized ones (like Yeti, Tervis, Nalgene, S'well, etc) will not fit. (I haven't tested out the Disney meal plan cups yet, but I'll be surprised if they fit in the cupholder.) This is compounded by the fact that the storage area between the cup holders cannot be used as a cupholder either because the one-hand folding mechanism is right over it. So - if you are accustomed to using anything bigger than a 20oz pop bottle and want to use this stroller for a trip, it basically does not have cupholders that you can use. This may not be a big deal to you, but I was disappointed to realize this after I had purchased the stroller.If you are not worried about the cupholders, this stroller is great (especially for the price). Even with the cupholders, I'm pleased with it.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RV7LERXW9ZQ7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,2,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

04/27/2019,United States,5,Lauren S,Lightweight and so much storage!,"We bought this as a lightweight stroller for travel and love it!! I researched a lot of strollers to find one that was both lightweight and had a nice sized canopy and found this one.Pros:-it’s super light-the canopy blocks a lot of sunlight-it fits through X-ray machines at the airport-the storage basket is so big my boppy even fits!-the handles are comfortable and far enough out that I’m not kicking the bottom of the stroller, unlike other ones we tried.Cons-the cup holders are a little small. We could fit a plastic water bottle (like Dasani) but not our reusable water bottle.-the stroller is a little hard to close and open without the kids tray, but it’s a little hard to get them into the stroller when the tray is there.

Instead of drifting off to sleep he’s doing happy baby yoga poses. The seat isn’t angled properly. It’s light, but it doesn’t fold up tight. The directions to put it together were terrible.

I was so excited to finally get this stroller but when I assembled it I was noticing things that I really didn’t like. In order to even put the seat up and down you have to move it with a clasp which was not easy to do. I couldn’t get mine to stay up at all. With that being said the actual seat itself is literally almost all cardboard. There’s no cushion to it once so ever which I wouldn’t want my child to have to sit in or nap it. I don’t recommend this stroller.

04/25/2019,United States,5,Rob,Saved $$ buying this instead!!,"My 4-year-old son (40 lbs) likes to wander, so on walks he needs to be in a stroller or on a leash. He is getting older and I know he will do better with age, so I didn't want to spend the big bucks on a jogging stroller, etc., to get a stroller that fits over 50 lbs. This stroller perfectly fits our needs. He sits upright strapped in comfortably and securely (that he can't unbuckle!!), the added safety (for him and me!!) of a tray in front of him that fits a 16.9 oz water bottle perfectly without falling over on bumps and holds a snack if needed, has little side pockets next to him in his seat to put a couple little toys if he wants, and a large canopy that gives him great shade. I have a comfy handlebar I can push with one hand, two cup holders that hold 16.9 oz water bottles perfectly without falling over on bumps, a small tray that holds my phone and keys, a large basket for storage, and easy to operate brakes. The stroller is easy to fold (you do have to take off the tray to fold up, but no big deal) and stands upright.

My only complaints are that when you try to fold it up or if my daughter folds back the canopy while she is in it, it will slam on your fingers. You have to be careful to avoid that when folding it up to store it. I'm also not crazy about how the tray clips into the front. There's no easy release where my daughter can quickly get in and out.

03/26/2019,United States,3,Tracy,Lightweight,"We bought this to replace our large/heavy infant stroller for traveling. This item was extremely light and compact for its size, only good things about it.It was not a one handed fold stroller and not good for use on anything other than very smooth surfaces. After 10 days of vacation use our wheels are squeaking and have holes in them. However it did what we wanted it for. After a few days of actual use we wished we had more storage space, the basket on bottom is good for loose items only, not bags or a small backpack even. The parent cup holders are useless, very small and in the way of the handle for pushing. Hard to get child in and out of the seat unless they are small because the tray is stationary so you have to pull the child up and out of the seat.Our son is 4 years old, 32 pounds and 41 tall, and he looked like a very large kid in it! The actual seat depth is only 9 and the back doesn't lay completely flat. It has a strap on the back that you loosen or tighten to recline the seat, kind of weird.Not good for napping at all. Had to put the seat belt on him, even though he said it hurt him, to prevent him from slipping out.I would say this is good for smaller children and the weight rating should be less than stated, it was a bit hard to maneuver with our son sitting in it.Glad it wasn't too expensive or we would be very unhappy with purchase because we can't return it now that it has been used.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NI9JOMQU16LY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,0,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)

01/23/2019,United States,5,Kayla,Perfect.,"This is exactly what I was looking for! Our original one-seater was a Baby Trend jogger. It was great but bulky and heavy.

Now that baby #1 is old enough to mostly walk everywhere, this thing is my new best friend. It’s incredibly light (I carry it with one arm), folds down compact for my trunk, stands up by itself when it’s folded, and still has all the features you just get attached to with your bigger strollers (5-point harness, window canopy, parent tray, removable kiddo tray, front shocks, reclining seat, storage basket...).

12/18/2018,United States,3,Zanim,Had slightly higher expectations,Received this yesterday. Assembly was easy. It’s somewhat sturdier than a regular parachute stroller. What I didn’t like is 1) the buckle strap has no shoulder pads which is quite uncomfortable 2) there is no cushion or padding or support in between the legs beside the belt so my little one keeps sliding except the buckle prevents it but I can’t imagine the discomfort having the buckle press against the area and 3) there isn’t an upright position. It’s always in slight recline which means my little one has to push himself forward to get his munchies from the snack tray.I’m assuming the stroller will do for short trips here and there but I can’t imahine my LO being in it for longer periods of time.,,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P97FV0JT7T1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,1,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

11/28/2018,United States,3,katie,Great for travel but not good for every day stroller,"This stroller is great for occasional travel but definitely not for every day use. All three cup holders are too small to fit an adult or child’s cup that I own. I tried to fit a bottle, sippy cup, and an adult tumbler cupAnd none will fit. I’m not sure the type of cup that would fit in the cup holders? Stroller pushes great, better than I thought for an inexpensive stroller. Very lightweight and inexpensive compared to other strollers. I have three kids and this is the 7th stroller I’ve owned. I’m returning it because it didn’t meet my needs. The cup holders not fitting any kind of cup or bottle was a problem. It is not a one hand close stroller as stated. This close requires two hands and is very awkward. I have small hands and found this close to be difficult. Also I could not push it with one hand, because the location of the large closing mechanism is right in the middle of the handle bar which causes you to have to select a side to push from, and doesn’t push straight very well. Once closed the stroller is not locked closed, and comes open as you try to put it in and out of the car. There may have been a manual clasp to keep it closed, but that’s too much work for something I thought was a one handed close. Most strollers automatically lock when in a closed position. I always have a kid or bag in my other hand and one handed criteria is a must for me. The biggest problem was the positioning of the seat. There is no definite seat back, rather my 1yr old was almost in a C shape like laying in a hammock, but more inverted. This caused him to not be able to sit up well and he was almost suspended by the crotch strap. It looked very uncomfortable in the crotch . Other reviews note the lack of back support as well.

I’m a new grandmother and bought it for when my granddaughter comes over, which will be often as she only lives 5 minutes away. The real problem is that the back does not recline enough for a newborn to lay comfortably. And b/c of that, w/o a head support, any newborn will not be able to “sit” in the stroller w/o her head rolling to one side. The stroller is also cheaply made. The foot rest is not fixed...it moves up & down. The harness/straps are not padded and seem scratchy. The only good thing I can say about this stroller is that it is lightweight. But that doesn’t make up for all the other problems. So, overall, it’s an overpriced, poorly made stroller that is not suitable for babies under the age of six months.

09/30/2018,United States,4,Amazon Customer,Great Quality and Usability for the Price,"First purchased this stroller in early 2017 (?? Can't locate the original order) because the one my daughter had was pretty heavy. Just ordered a new one: The first trip the airline baggage handlers bent one side of the front wheels. :-( Managed to get them fairly straight so continued using it. Then I accidentally backed over it with my car when it was unfolded. Still usable for just over a year. Now, the damaged wheels (see above) have worn out so I'm replacing it.Pros: Light weight, easy to move around. Large basket underneath for storage (hang the diaper bag over the handle). Canopy is large to keep the elements off and baby comfortable (sun, rain snow). Granddaughter loves it, fits her well both awake and asleep. Comfortable and she can't get out of the harness on her own.Cons: No way is it - or was it ever - one handed folding. Takes 2 hands and sometimes it sticks when open and you're trying to close.I think it's great for the price.

05/11/2018,United States,2,LPetrie,This stroller quickly became my worst enemy,"Pro: When open, this stroller works great, rolls smoothly, has a large basket. Essentially, it works as it should.Cons: Too many to list, primarily having to do with opening and closing the stroller. First, it is not easy at all to close, as the one hand close implies. Second, when closed, you can only latch it closed if it is still partially open. It collapses decently tightly, however, you have to open it probably an additional 3-4 to be able to latch it. We regularly use this on trams and trolleys where it needs to be closed for the ride. However, my options are either to latch it, in which case its too big to fit easily on the tram leading to some very awkward struggles, or to close the whole way, and deal with it falling open while I am trying to climb in. Third, while closed the large basket is completely open and now vertical, so anything in there falls out. Finally, it is not easy to open. There is no foot stand to help open it. I have found the only decent way to get it open and locked in place is to grab by the sides and shake until it is open enough to set it down, and then push down on the sides.If you are planning to use this stroller in any situation where it will need to be opened and closed on the go, DO NOT BUY.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R0PYKL333UM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,11,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

I like all the stages of the shade, it comes all the way down but has a halfway point and can pull all the way back. The screen window to see your kid doesn't require the opening of a flap you can always see them. The seat reclines to whatever angle you want by tightening the strap. I'm tall and the stroller height is still fine for me. There are two trays both with cupholders. There's a foot rest. I like that the stroller isn't too wide so it's perfect to get through aisles or like I said easy to maneuver and runs smooth. The folding is not one handed it's a little tricky and it doesn't fold down as small as my other stroller (that I ended up returning for other reasons) but it's still not too bad. Last thing I really like the slate color I'm not sure the difference between the plus and the sport because the dimensions are the same on the website.

So far, I'm not impressed.Pros: the basket is accessible and I can fit my small diaper bag - umbrella strollers I've tried in this price range can't fit it which is the main reason I am trying this one. It is easy to close. It folds relatively flat.Cons: to close is easy, but to fold it up is annoying - the front wheels have to be turned for it to fold up which is annoying. Also once folded, the latch is horrible - it easily comes undone and the stroller folds up smaller than the latch locks at which wouldn't be too big of a problem if the latch didn't come undone so easily. the baby cup holder is pretty small in diameter and shallow.I haven't used the recline feature with the baby yet, but I'm weary of the belt being difficult to easily adjust once the baby's weight is against the back.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F9CCDAK8MGB1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,1,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

My toddler is too tall (a little over 3ft) for it and his feet touch the wheels when he falls asleep. Because it doesnt recline, when he sleeps, his head is leaning on one of the hard joints and I have to make him a pillow out of a blanket. I still fight with it to close, one hand mechanism is still jammed. When it does close, the wheels have to be aligned by hand or it will warp the wheels. Needless to say I dont like having to use my hands on wheels that have rolled all over NYC streets, so my wheels are warped. I think I say I hate this stroller every time I have to use it. Currently searching for a new one.*I love that it’s lightweight, has a decent sized basket and runs smoothly. I do wish that the cup holders by the handle could fit something bigger than a small Poland spring bottle. I also wish it could lie back a little more.

It's a great stroller, it's well made but yet it's light enough for my petite wife to pick up.

02/10/2018,United States,4,Tristin,Really convenient and light weight stroller!,We have had purchased this stroller in December 2017 for Christmas vacation and knew we would be traveling from airport to airport. This is just the stroller we needed to get through the airport and especially helpful going through security. I was able to fold this stroller down while holding my 15 month old in one arm. This does fold down to fit through the X-ray system. The only things that I wish were bigger in this are the cup holders and the storage basket below but these can work since it IS a smaller lightweight stroller.

02/06/2018,United States,4,McCann,Love this stroller for its price point,"Love this stroller for its price point. There are drawbacks to it though. I bought this one because it is lightweight and has a child tray (few strollers have a tray that are lightweight). The tray is a little small, it could’ve been a little wider. My toddlers munchkin 360 cup barely fits in it, she can set it on top of the cup holder. Another reason I purchased this was because it also came with a parent console, then came to realize my water bottle doesn’t even fit in it. Not a big deal but I’m hoping a small water bottle or a coffee will fit in there. Folds up really easily, folds out really easily and putting it together was very simple.

Today we received the stroller, I thought I can put this stroller together quick, I was wrong, the front wheels were that much of a pain. I called Kolcraft, the lady was nice. Here’s where the problem with them lies, they wanted a video emailed to them of me putting the wheels on, the soonest they could get back to me is tomorrow.Did I mention I have a toddler, I don’t always have time when others do, so tomorrow just wasn’t going to work for me.God is so good to me because the thought try utube came to mind, so that’s what I did. That’s where I learned real fast I was putting the wheels on upside down.Mainly because I had no idea there where arrows on the wheels, and no idea the arrows need to be pointing up which puts the tab that’s to be facing you, at the bottom.Then and only then will you get the wheels on correctly with out hurting your fingers.In truth kolcraft should just put a link in the directions and send you to a utube video.After we use this stroller for awhile I will see about giving more stars.Bottom line so far I would recommend this stroller.

It has one solid handle bar so you can add clips to hook bags on and other things. However, the product description is just not true. It is not at all one-handed anything. I have never successfully opened or closed it all the way with one hand. Forget about holding my baby while doing it. I had to put my baby down on the floor in my lobby in order to use both hands to open the stroller. (She was not happy.) I haven't figured out how to get the seat back to stay in any position, altho that could just be me. I also haven't figured out how to loosen the straps to fit around my baby. That one is not just me. My husband and my friend were also both unsuccessful. The large basket does not hold my diaper back pack. It looks pretty small. The thing that locks the wheels is not one uniform lock. There's a separate lock for each wheel. As opposed to my other stroller that has one lock for both back wheels, which is a lot easier.

There is a strap in the back to adjust the recline, but it takes the seating from super reclined to very reclined at best. Even after having the strap adjusted to have the least recline, my daughter is sitting awkward as if she’s about to slide off. Reclining was my #1 requirement when shopping for a stroller, so a little disappointed with the result. 2) when folding the stroller down, the front wheels get in the way and prevent you from fully collapsing it. You have to manually move the front wheels around to collapse properly. It’s not a big deal, and doesn’t happen all the time, but can be annoying when you’re in a rush or child is screaming.

09/25/2017,United States,4,DeeL42,Can't fold with one hand,"I bought this to replace a lightweight Zobo stroller that was ruined. It was between this stroller and the Summer Infant 3D Lite Stroller. I chose this based on the weight, the front tray and the extended sun shade. All in all, the stroller handles nicely and is easy to maneuver. It's lighter than my Zobo stroller, but folding it is not nearly as simple. The Zobo could easily be folded with one hand, perfect while holding a baby or bags. For this stroller, you can work the folding mechanism with one hand, but I find you need your other hand to push it closed. It can also be tricky to get all the way folded and the latching mechanism doesn't seem to match the size to when it's completely folded. This stroller is also longer once folded, so it doesn't fit as nicely in the trunk of my full-size Avalon as the Zobo did. The tray was a deal-breaker for me as I put snacks in it when we go for walks and I like the larger storage compartment for putting my purse and diaper bag, but the folding mechanism needs some work, which is why I only gave it four stars.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17SJ1Z9I7T98C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,0,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

A 16,9oz plastic bottle of water from the grocery store fits perfectly. I am 5ft 8in tall and the handle is at a perfect height. There is lots of room for a small diaper bag or purchases in the bottom basket.

07/20/2017,United States,4,Sumanth Krishna,Brilliant product,"Brilliant product. Thoroughly enjoy it.Pros:1. This stroller is SURPRISINGLY sturdy for the price.2. Incredibly lightweight.3. Very easy assembly4. The wheels work very well. The stroller moves very smooth.5. Nice little cup-holder for the baby.6. The storage space in the bottom is amazing. When we go for walks, we throw our keys and phones in there and it is very comfortable.7. The visor has a nice see-through sheet. My baby loves looking through that at me when I am pushing her and laugh. It makes her so much happier that she can see me when in the stroller.Cons:1. It advertises its One Hand Fold, which is not completely true. I always need to push the front against a wall while turning the knob on the handle to be able to fold it. And even when it does fold, we need to MASH the folded part in for it to lock in place. If not, it just keeps popping back out.2. The cup holder by the handle is a weird placement. If the visor is not out, the visor gets in the way of the cup holder. So if you have a cup in the cup holder and you pull the visor back, it knocks your drink off. Not that big a deal, but it is just weird.3. The breaks are a bit hard to apply. It does not lock easily. If you are wearing flipflops, you may break your toenail trying to take the break off.4. The shoulder strap is placed weird. My 1 year old can just pull her hand out of it. We never put the shoulder straps on anyway, but when we do, she can pull herself out of it in a second.Overall:If you are looking for a stroller that can handle a bit of walking off roads and is easy to carry around, definitely go for it.

07/10/2017,United States,5,K. Galindo,Very very pleased with stroller and a great price!,"My stroller needs recently changed and I was in search of a lightweight stroller ideal for traveling. I purchased 3 different strollers (part of which because I had to buy some online) to compare side by side and I decided on this one. The other two strollers were the Summer Infant 3D lite and the Summer Infant 3D one. The Kolcraft and 3D lite are in the same class and price point (though Kolcraft is slightly cheaper). In the end, the extra 5 lbs of weight in the Summer Infant 3D one is why I took it back, but it was a really nice stroller and had more bells and whistles. I returned the 3D lite because the Kolcraft was essentially a miniature version of my current Chicco Bravo stroller. The canopy is excellent with a peek-a-boo window and it has 3 total cup holders (a feature that is hard to find in this class of strollers). The reclining mechanism is not quite as good as I'd like, but I hardly use that feature as it is. I've taken it on test runs with baby and I am very happy with it. It's super light weight, which was important for me because I'm short and have wrist problems now. Baby seems to like it plenty and it is very nice having the snack tray with cup holder in the front. The storage space below is big enough to hold my baby bag, but it also hangs on the handles well too!",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13Z647BSIB5MP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,69,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)
07/10/2017,United States,4,sarcastchick,Got one for Grandma and Grandpa - now we're getting one for us!,"I purchased this stroller as a compact, yet full-size option for my parents, since our daughter stays with them during the week. My husband and I decided to take it out of the box and take it for a spin before handing it over and immediately decided we will purchase another to replace our huge stroller that came as part of a travel system.PROS: It is very lightweight, folds up easily (although I don't really think a one-handed fold is possible), stands on its own in the folded position, and takes up much less trunk space. This stroller doesn't have all the bells and whistles of our full-size stroller, but it's definitely a step above an umbrella stroller. My daughter actually looks more comfortable sitting in this stroller than our expensive travel system. The bottom basket is big enough to hold a purse or small diaper bag. I love the extension hood on the canopy that helps block out more sun when necessary and easily slides out of the way when not needed. The handles arc up to a comfortable height. I am 5'8 and my husband is 5'10 and we both felt hunched over our umbrella stroller. This is a much more comfortable height.CONS: The cup holders are ridiculously small. This may not be an issue for most, but if you haul around 32-ounce water bottles like me, they won't fit. The window in the canopy for keeping an eye on the little one doesn't have a cover. This isn't really a con for me because those little flap things on most strollers never seem to stay open when you want them to and I figure I can always place a light blanket or sweater over the window to block sun if needed, but others may find this to be a problem. I don't love the 5-point harness: the lap belt buckles, but the shoulder straps don't buckle into the center harness. They attach with a hook clasp, which makes it a little tougher to get my daughter in and out. It doesn't recline much and you have to manually adjust the harness on the back to get it to recline, but I found this gave my daughter a better posture and, as I said, she looks more comfortable in it. The plastic wheels don't look terribly sturdy, but the ride appears to be pretty smooth.Overall, I think this is an excellent value for the price. I love having the convenience of a full size stroller in something so compact. Someone said it was the perfect stroller for grandparents, but I would say it's also great for parents who want more comfort for their kid with the ease of an umbrella stroller. While we plan to hang onto our monster jogging stroller for longer walks, this is perfect for running errands or short walks.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36IMH7RH9VR0J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,2,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

06/29/2017,United States,3,ThisTrain,When travelling...,"We bought the same model about two years ago for our older child and this is slightly different in not-so-much-better ways. 1) when folded, the lock does not lock tightly, and when you try to tighten/flatten it more, the lock comes undone. The old one wouldn't flatten all the way, either, but it would at least stay locked when flattened further (e.g., it's natural that it become more flattened when in a full trunk), 2) when folded and locked, the older one folded in such a way that you could roll the folded stroller on its wheels-super convenient. With this latest one, the basket drags on the floor so you can't roll it, it can only be carried. Bummer. The good news is that it is fairly light, but we were counting on this feature, as we are going to the airport with lots of other bags to carry... Also, like the older model, this has terrible back support, the tray is cumbersome to remove (watch your manicures!), and the cupholder is too small and shallow. Why did we buy this-again? We needed a lightweight stroller for air travel and the umbrella ones don't accomodate older/larger toddlers.

I love the 5 point harness, the easy to use brakes, the wheels that get over most bumps (not for off-roading though) and the easy maneuverability of this stroller. The large basket underneath is a bonus too. However, there are a few down sides to this stroller. First, they have a major flaw in the trays; those cup holders are too small for any cup I've ever seen! And it's not that they don't have room for it, they just don't make it the shape that fits cups. It's more of a bumpy oval than a circle. Second, their canopy extension doesn't stay collapsed if you don't want to use it. It falls down from it's folded position more often than stays shut. One more item I wanted to to mention is that this stroller is NOT a one handed fold, BUT it is very easy to fold.That being said, I would very much recommend this stroller for travel.

04/16/2017,United States,3,L. K. Hayes,"The wheels have to be in a perfect position, which I'm having to do manually","I bought this stroller because I already own the regular Cloud, which my large 1 1/2 yr old has somewhat outgrown. I did a bit of research before purchasing. What swayed me in favor of the Cloud Plus were the following factors:One hand fold5 put harnessRider trayParent trayReclining seatIt has more bells and whistles than the regular Cloud, for sure. I just assembled it today but I already foresee problems with said upgrades. First, the one hand fold is awkward. Even following directions in manual, it doesn't fold every time. Maybe I'll figure out the magic formula eventually. It also doesn't fold to the standing or even storing position without serious cajoling. The wheels have to be in a perfect position, which I'm having to do manually.The rider tray doesn't flip like other strollers do. It has to be manually snapped completely on and off every time child wants to get in or out. Tedious. This is going to be a real pain. I like the parent tray, however.The reclining seat reclines to about 45 degrees. This will work for my toddler but I can see where parents might like a more flat reclining position. The big problem for us is that when upright, it's not erect enough for us. My toddler wants to sit up more than possible with this stroller. So she strains. I put a towel behind her to prop her up more but I don't feel like this is a realistic option when we use it at the zoo or other place where she's in and out a lot.I guess all in all it's a decent value for the money.

The stroller folds up another two inches and then the latch pops off and the stroller unfolds.

02/23/2017,United States,4,Amazon Customer,Loving It!,"I love this stroller, is so lightweight and it rolls very nicely. It is on the smaller side, so I wouldn't recommend to taller people. I'm 5'4 and it is just about right for me. My daughter (she's two months) loves it so much. She used to love her car seat as a Newborn, but as she got older and more curious, she acts like the car seats are too constricting. I popped her in this and she immediately stopped crying when I rolled her around(rolled her around for an hour and only took her out because she needed a diaper change). I purchased the Summer Infant Snuzzler head support and it fits great. This is going to make my upcoming trip to Texas a lot easier. And shopping. Baby is too heavy for me to carry and she screams when she's in her car seat too long. Two months and fourteen pounds 😲😨 And it helps soothe her to sleep. All in all, I love this stroller. It only gets four stars because of the horrid smell. It smells like chemicals and cat pee. Like if they were to make a chemical smell based off cat pee, this would be it. I remember thinking when I opened it, 'Did a freaking cat pee right next to me?'. It gave me a head ache",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OGV5XXDYHA9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,2,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)
02/22/2017,United States,4,IH,Great everyday stroller for occasional outdoor use.,"I gave this stroller only four stars because when you have it upright, it's still inclined at about 110° and my toddler will only use strollers with a full upright backrest. I also need more sun coverage than the canopy provides due to the intense heat in this city.These ussues aside, I would recommend this stroller for everyday use because it is easy to open and close, lift, has a moderate canopy (not enough for this Texas weather but great for mostly indoor use or moderately sunny days), and it has a generous and accessible storage basket.Although the backrest does recline further back, it does not lie flat. The foot rest is in a fixed position. The handlebar is in a fixed position and great for short to average height parents. I don't recommend this stroller for taller than average parents.The stroller also comes with EVA (sturdy, molded plastic) wheels. However, they have ridges on the wheels which makes them more suitable to occasionally riding over gravel (think of strolling around and only some parts of the road have sidewalks while other parts have gravel). We do a lot of walking and don't have fully cemented sidewalks here. Because of these wheels and the front end suspension, I'd be completely confident that my child would be comfortable in this stroller when we ride over spots that are missing the sidewalk and only have gravel. Also note that if you plan to use this stroller for more children, you can buy replacement wheels and easily install them.If your child doesn't mind a slight incline when sitting up, doesn't need to lie flat on his back, you don't need a lot of sun protection (you use a stroller outdoors only occasionally or have lots of shade as in a wooded park) and you are not tall, then I highly recommend this stroller.Unfortunately, we live in an extremely hot city where just opening the doors of you house make the water in your eyeballs start to evaporate. Yeah, the heat is intense here. Moreover, my child will only use stroller where she can sit completely upright so this stroller sadly won't work for us.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4WL7IOHJ8OM3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,1,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

02/20/2017,United States,5,camelca,Good for the price,We were looking for our second stroller to replace heavy and bulky travel system stroller for coming vacations. We just put it together and use it inside of house and here are my likes and drawbacks.Likes:- light- easy to assemble- reclines in 2 positions- cup holder & tray (cup holders are small still our son's cups and our travel mug fit just fine)- canopy covers well- big storage (kind strange front side is open tho)Drawbacks:- not one hand folding. You need to use your the other hand to push tray toward handle to fold- i do not like the brake unlocking mechanism. You need to push up the lock with your toe. If you are wearing flip-flop your big toe kind hurts...Overall these drawbacks are not deal breaker for us. For the price this stroller has a lot of features. It has a latch to keep the stroller in fold position but stroller gets flatter if you don't use it.,,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R110KT0OSDUZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,1,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)
02/20/2017,United States,2,Anna Y.,OK for kids under 20 lbs only,"It is super light, very fast to assemble, and a great travel stroller for younger kids. However, it did not work for my 3 year old. My child is very very small for his age (I'm talking super tiny, weighs 24 lbs, so skinny he's diagnosed with failure to thrive and close to getting a G-tube) and this stroller is too small for him. I think it is OK for kids less than 20 lbs. The max weight on this is 40lbs but I have no idea how a 40 lb kid can sit in this. I will be returning this because we took it out for the first time today, used it for 2 hours and whole time my kid was super uncomfortable, about to fall out of the seat.

12/27/2016,United States,1,Tricia,WORST STROLLER EVER,"I needed a stroller for a recent trip to Disneyworld. My current light weight stroller was lost in a sea of boxes and I figured grabbing a new one wouldn't be bad. I compared strollers AND reviews and took a chance on this stroller. I don't think I've ever hated something so much in my life.-the cup holders are tiny. You have to really push a regular sized bottle of water into it. And when you pull the bottle out, the whole cup holder tray comes off.-the cup holder on the kid size is even smaller, you can't even fit a water bottle in there. Maybe a juice box could fit. Maybe.-it says one handed closing. LIES. With two hands, both my husband and I had issues which lead to much cussing on the buses to the park. Once you finally get it closed, if you are lucky enough to line up the wheels JUST FREAKING SO, you have to use this little lock hook to keep it closed only any small jostle will pop it off which means your stroller opens up. Cue a lot more cussing.-the seat back is not soft at all. The part where the mesh meets the seat (where your kid will rest his or her head) is super hard. It hurt my sons head from day one so we'd have to try to keep a blanket bunched up to keep him comfortable but it was really hot so he'd get sweaty really fast. While it was nice to have a little mesh window to see my kid while I'm strolling him along, I hated it was at the price of his comfort.-trying to take the tray off and snap it back on was uber annoying.-If you are tall, this is not the stroller for you.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WVDG0UDJGK81/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,12,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

12/21/2016,United States,3,Amanda H Moseley,Could use some improvements,"For a lightweight, quick and easy stroller this is just fine. It opens and closes relatively easily and is very lightweight. The brakes work well and the storage is decent. The cup holders are all pretty small however and don't fit our sippy cups which is a nuisance, and it's frustrating that the seat doesn't decline all the way or smoothly, it's not a one step process unless you gather the fabric together as you loosen it and then slowly low the seat down yourself. And lifting it can't be done all at once either so there's not much luck in keeping a baby asleep while adjusting the seat if needed. Otherwise my son has fallen asleep so it will do the trick! All in all, it works but I would have rather waited and spent a little extra for the fully reclining seat and better cup holders.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PXU5CV5X8GSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,12,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)

This stroller does not roll along it as well as my baby trend jogger stroller did. I get stuck quite a bit on the smallest bumps. If the wheels were slightly bigger and were the kind you put air in rather than plastic, it would probably roll along better. Other than that, very happy with this purchase.

10/22/2016,United States,4,Rae,Shallow seat but otherwise great for price and the options!,"I was looking for a small portable stroller for the van. I was very specific in wanting a stroller that had a sun shade that would cover my child's face well, a tray or bar in front so that he could hold on as well as preventing him from falling out while young, parent tray for phone. keys or water, a basket underneath for any items we may need to carry with us and one that would be comfortable. We have used this for now three months. It has been a great stroller. It collapses pretty easy. Some times I have to recollapses multiple times to get it to fold completely, but it will stand up on its own after its completely folded (and with a child on the hip, so sometimes a one hand fold). The sun shade pulls down quite far and covers from the sun glare. The bottle tray is very small and only holds small water bottles, but we place bigger ones int he basket and use the tray for toys or the phone. The only thing I didn't like, which I would have returned it had my husband not thrown the box away is the seat is very shallow. My son always looks lke hes falling out and has less comfort to fit his big bottom (hes only 10 months so not sure how long he will fit). Typically he is in this stroller for short periods of time through a store so the shallow seat doesnt seem to make a huge difference.Also to add- we have traveled with this stroller, flying, and it did the job well. The basket sticks out quite a bit in the back so I was able to hook my diaper bag to the back of the stroller and have the bag sit on the basket and still utilize the basket for other items.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV6H21HP1FMKH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,4,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)

I own two Peg Perego Easy Vela but kept having problems with the front wheels.In my opinion, this stroller is light alright.

The seat is wide enough but it's definitely very short. My son is 4yrs old and weighs 38 lbs. I doubt that this will hold comfortable any child more than 40 lbs (again, in my opinion).The basket underneath is not as big and if you push items to far they will fall through the other side.

10/03/2016,United States,5,HappyTraveler,Best Travel Stroller for WDW,"We purchased this stiller in early 2016 for use on a May trip to Walt Disney World (WDW). We paid full price on Amazon and were neither compensated, nor solicited, for our feedback in anyway. Since purchasing the stroller, it has been to WDW twice – once in May and again in July of 2016. We bought this stroller after extensive research and reading every review on just about every light-weight stroller on Amazon and at Babies-R-Us. The stroller arrived quickly (Two Days-Prime) after placing our order. Assembly was easy – attach straps to seat, snap in front wheels and attached the front child’s tray.PROS:1. Very light weight – I can easily lift with one arm.2. Easy one-handed open and close - great for when you have the infant in the other hand.3. Strong safety straps – child is held in securely with five point restraints.4. Tall enough for a 5’10” man and a 5’6” woman to use comfortably5. Sun visor is far reaching and easily cover child in the harshest of sunlight.6. Durable – survived two round trip flights, and countless open and close folds in and out of a car’s trunk with no defects7. Easy to steer and maneuver – wheels roll easily over smooth and semi-smooth surfaces.8. Storage basket under stroller is large9. Drink holders for parent’s drinks securely holds bottles and cups.10. When folded, child’s tray does not touch the ground11. When folded stroller is self-standingCONS:1. Folding lock is to long – stroller folds up smaller than locking device allows – not a big deal an only an issue when needing to lock closed when boarding passenger trams and trains, etc. We did not use it when loading into trunk or placing into gate check bag.2. Child cannot lay complete flat, not sit up completely straight – However, our son had no problem falling asleep in the stroller when fully reclined. Lays out to about 160 degree. Does not sit child up vertically at 90 degrees. Child can only sit back at about 10 degrees from vertical. Again, son did not have any issues sitting in stroller for long periods.We would purchase this stroller again without hesitation.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MON5QWUCTDXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,7,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

09/30/2016,United States,3,Money Honey,"Good Travel Stroller, but not durable enough for everyday use.","Good Stroller for the price.PROS:1. Extremely light weight and great for travel.2. The umbrella offers much better cover than many of the other strollers available in this price point.3. The similar light weight Graco stroller didn't offer the full harness like this one, and with our squirmy little toddler a full restraint was a must.4. Extremely compact when folded.CONS:1. The recline of the back of the stroller is awkward and can't really be adjusted easily.2. The basket underneath is very tiny and its difficult to get things in and out of it, especially when your child is in the stroller.3. This is not a one hand fold stroller, the wheels have to be in an exact position or it won't fold correctly. Additionally it doesn't stay locked in a folded position well. Just picking it up to move it can cause it to open which can be a pain.4. It's really not meant for everyday use. We originally purchased the stroller exclusively for when we were traveling because of how light it was and it was well below the airline stroller weight restriction. However, 3 months ago we moved to the city of Chicago and now use the stroller every single day to take our son to and from daycare and to activities on the weekend, and the stroller is just not made for that type of beating.Ultimately the stroller has been great for travel and its probably the best stroller at this price point but now that we're in the city we've upgraded to the far more durable Baby Jogger City Mini.

06/25/2016,United States,3,Rebekah P,"I kept it, but wouldn't buy again","I struggled with whether I should give this stroller 3 or 4 stars. I ultimately decided on 3, because, while it does, in a basic way, deliver what a lightweight stroller should (simply put, convenience), I don't use it for its intended purpose (travel) because of the cons I will list.I assembled it myself in about 10 minutes, no problems, very simple.It looks great - bright red and true black, no fading so far (I've owned it for right at a year now).I use this stroller primarily while walking in my neighborhood and while taking my older kids back and forth to the bus stop. I use my full-size stroller when in public, because it is larger, more comfortable for my baby, and has more features.This stroller's wheels, while plastic, have stood the test of time. They're still in very good shape, despite old, bumpy asphalt being our most frequently traveled terrain.The cup holders seemed like an awesome feature on a lightweight stroller, but they're awfully small. They don't even fit a water bottle. I usually just lay a water bottle across the canopy, or put it in the impressively roomy basket underneath. The child's tray doesn't begin to fit a sippy cup, so I use it for cheerios or other baby snacks (only recommended if you clean and disinfect regularly!! LOL).The ride is smooth, and maneuverability is good. The sun shade has really great coverage, and I love the peekaboo window.As many reviewers have stated, the seat back is horrible. Truly, it is pitifully designed. My 9-lb baby's weight bent it in half. It seems to be reinforced with a flimsy piece of cardboard. The recline feature is a strap that you tighten or loosen, to change the angle of the seat. It doesn't recline the seat, though; it's more like it adjusts the level of SLUMP. My baby cannot sit up straight in this stroller, unless she leans forward and sits up without support. If she falls asleep, she practically hugs herself with her shoulders when I lay the seat back as far as it goes. That said, I fear that her breathing could be blocked, so I just don't let her sleep in it, if I can help it.The one-handed fold is a little tricky, but once you get used to it, it's simple. However, UNFOLDING is far more often than not a pain in the rear. Here's why: when opening the stroller from the folded position, the flimsy, bent-in-half seat back gets stuck, and it folds itself into notches and behind bars, and prohibits you from unfolding the stroller and locking it open. It took me an hour to truly figure out what in the world was keeping it from unfolding, why it happened almost every time I used the stroller, and how to quickly fix it each time I open it, so that I wasn't struggling for 15 minutes before I could put my baby in it. That is the main reason I don't travel with this stroller. It stays parked in my garage, open (thus rendering the 1-hand-fold feature useless), so I can pop the baby in and go when it's time to catch the bus.Bonus - the size of this stroller is perfect for an inexpensive, generic whole-stroller rain/wind cover. When inclement weather threatens my big kids' extracurricular activities, the baby is snug as a bug, because the cover protects the entire stroller.I kept the stroller, but I wouldn't buy it again.

This one caught my eye because of the features listed above and the promised 1-hand-fold — I use this stroller every day for daycare drop-offs with a toddler and a baby, so I loved the idea of being able to fold up the stroller with the baby on my hip. Unfortunately, you really do need two hands to properly fold the stroller together and technically you are supposed to lock it with a little latch too (though I've found that it stays pretty well together once collapsed). I was about to return the stroller, because it didn't fold easily with one hand, but after researching more I arrived at my original conclusion that for the price, this stroller is still the best option. I tried it for a few more days and once I figure out how to quickly collapse it, I just accepted that I still need both hands to fold it and I decided I still liked the other features enough to keep it.After having used the stroller for a few months for daycare drop-offs and outings, it has grown on me and I do like it. The two things that I still wish were improved are:1) the seat should adjust to be more upright, so my baby doesn't slouch as much in the seat; maybe the seat area could also be a bit bigger to give more traction for the baby to hold himself more upright2) the basket front should be closed so that things don't slide outThe other stroller we considered is the Summer Infant 2015 3D Lite Convenience Stroller (

I needed something light, portable, and yet affordable for my family trip to Italy (for visiting relatives). The height of the handles is short for me and I'm 5'5, but it's easy to get used to. This stroller was very convenient and great, AT FIRST. But upon my return home and being spoiled by the convenience of a lighter and smaller stroller compared to my son's heavy duty bulky stroller, I used it more and more for short walking trips. As of recently, it has become a major safety hazard to use it. More so for myself than my son. I almost fractured my leg on this the other day (I have major bruises on my front left leg) and then today I almost fell backwards down the front stairs with this. The thing that has made this stroller extremely dangerous for me to use are the front wheels. They get caught up very easily and if I'm walking, the rear metal axil gets jammed into my legs very fast and viciously. But I will express, this stroller has indeed become dangerous for not just me but my son as well. If the stroller gets caught on the sidewalk, every 2-3 seconds, and my son is chewing on the tray from teething, he is likely to get badly hurt and it's happened once so far.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jTmabU0ML._SY1600.jpg,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZGO6ASA0XNJV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,80,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

05/06/2016,United States,4,J. C. Lin,"Featherlight, smooth ride, no surprises","Very light, sturdy, smooth ride and generally comfortable. It also stands quite easily when folded, which is convenient.A few things to note: the tray is a bit hard to pop on and off. A typical stroller will have a hinge and a latch. This stroller uses a clipping action of the semi-rigid plastic tray to the frame. Second, the back of the chair is somewhat reclined even at the most upright setting. I put it in quotes because the angle is defined by a strap that you tighten (upright) or loosen (reclined). The most upright angle is still fairly shallow, which means my child is always leaning a little bit back. Third, the cupholders, as mentioned by other reviewers, are indeed quite small and generally useless for their intended use. I still use them to store random things, so it's not a big deal.

04/20/2016,United States,2,Theresa Bogema,Not worth the savings,"Our family of 4 grew to a family of 5 when we went to China last month to adopt a little girl who was 4. We knew we'd want a stroller for all the airports and everything we'd be doing while in country. We looked at a lot of reviews and strollers before ordering this for our trip. It does stroll, it was sturdy enough to fit her, the straps work, and so does the canopy. That is about it with positives. After about a dozen one hand folds it started to take two hands and now I can only get it to fold when I hold my breath right. The sliding feature no longer slides all the way so it is next to impossible to get folded. This may seem like a small complaint, but the cup holders are too small. No kid cup, water bottle, etc. that we gave her will actually fit into the cup holder on the tray or near the handle. Moving around a lot trying to hold liquids was hard. We did take this all the way to China and back and we've used it multiple times every day for a little over a month, but there is already a hole in the mesh stow underneath. Don't make the mistake we did - pay a little more for a better quality stroller.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E26LRA3BXNFZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,5,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)
04/11/2016,United States,5,Andrew T.,Perfect Umbrella Stroller,"I researched quite a bit before deciding on this umbrella stroller and I'm so glad I did. This stroller was recommended in the book Baby Bargains. It has a great canopy, is easy to fold, has a large basket underneath, and also has a removable tray. This stroller is perfect to keep in my trunk for errands with my little guy. I use the Baby Jogger City Mini around our neighborhood that has lots of uneven sidewalks and hills, but for shopping this stroller is fantastic!",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37GB0LHUT49Y9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,18,B019DHBCXE,Color: Slate Grey (Wheel Color May Vary)

04/08/2016,United States,4,A.B.F.,Couldn't be happier with this purchase,"Today was my first day using our new stroller and I absolutely love it. We went to the zoo today and made it thru the day perfect with not a single issue. My 2yr daughter couldn't wait to get in it. I will say tho bc my daughter is tall for her age and her legs just dangled there (she was too lazy to keep them on the foot rest) but for her long legs she didn't hit the front wheels once. It was a smooth ride for her and easy push for me. I like the handles on the stroller, super soft and not so low. It was great having that basket underneath too bc then I didn't have to carry everything in my backpack. It's super light weight which is a plus bc I have a bad back so sometimes picking up that damn jogger stroller was a struggle. I do wish the cup holders were bigger but so far that has been the only down fall. I highly recommend this stroller. Even my husband loves it and he was against the idea of even getting a new stroller bc he thought she was too old for one. If I run into any issues later I'll be sure to update this.",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA54TOEI646PY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,2,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

03/21/2016,United States,4,jenk,Great umbrella stroller,"Lightweight, easy umbrella stroller to carry around. We purchased this for our one year old so that we could take it to Disneyland. For the money, it's great - it's easy to fold and unfold, it's not too heavy for me to carry (I have an uppababy and this is definitely lighter), and the basket size is a decent size (it can hold a couple baby blankets, a backpack with baby stuff in it, and a portable baby table).Pros: Lightweight, narrow, and maneuvers well on smooth surfaces. It's easy to fold and unfold. The snack tray is very useful. The sunshade blocks the sun well in the front. There are two cupholders that are permanently attached to the stroller handle and it holds water bottles and Starbucks coffee cups perfectly.Cons: It doesn't recline all the way. It leans back about 45 degrees. It also does not prop up all the way, either. So the baby is always at an angle. The foot rest is very low so the baby starts to slump down and basically is held in to the seat by her crotch. The seat where she is sitting is at a slight downward angle, as well. It's not great for baby to nap in. There is a mesh opening in the back of the sunshade so you can look down on the baby when he/she is sitting in the stroller, but there is no cover so the baby's head is exposed to the sun that way. You cannot make the handle higher or lower. The snack tray has a cupholder but it is very narrow so it doesn't hold any of the baby's cups.For the price it's great. My husband loves it and would rather use this one than the Uppababy Cruz so we have both taking up room in our car trunk.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UWQNJA6DS4AE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,15,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)

03/08/2016,United States,5,Amazon Customer,This stroller is amazing! I recommend it to all my friends,"This stroller is amazing! I recommend it to all my friends. It has replaced both my expensive full size stroller and the umbrella stroller. Pros: super lightweight! Easy fold, stands upright when folded, large shade, deep recline (my toddler easily took a full nap laying back in the shade) & excellent price, I would've paid more it's so great Cons: small cup holders, not a truly one hand fold, I usually need 2 hands but still much easier than umbrella (there is a button twist mechanism in the handle to press and the stroller folds in line with the handle and sometimes wheels don't align properly for fold so you need to pick it up with other hand so weeks rotate and align, but it's so light this is no trouble IMHO) I bought this for a trip to Disney so we could fit it through the security conveyor belt and on and off Disney busses. I went to the store multiple time to try out different models but they were all too heavy/bulky so I took a risk and ordered it, I could not be more pleased. It is the most lightweight stroller I've ever seen and worked great for the trip. Now I use it as an all purpose stroller because it's so light and easy to lift into the car for trips to the store and less weight to push on walks to the park.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PMAIHZDKOTOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ERMTUK,234,B017ERMTUK,Color: Fire Red (Wheel Color May Vary)
