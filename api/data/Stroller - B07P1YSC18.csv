04/24/2023,United States,2,Ashley Castro,No luck,"Got this stroller as we're taking a family vacation that requires flying and I didn't want to take out heavier and expensive stroller with. I've heard of this brand and know they make good umbrella strollers so I figured I'd buy it ahead of time to test it out. I was super excited when we go the stroller but when I put it together and tested it out on a store run, the front right wheel didn't fully touch the ground (picture one, tad hard to tell). I exchanged the stroller as I couldn't use it with ease and just two days later we got a new one. Well that one was even worse. The back right leg was bent at an odd angle (picture two). Picture three is the how we received the stroller (giant box, wrapped in thick paper. We didn't get the first stroller like that.) so I had a feeling even before opening it that something was wrong. I'm just fully returning it at this point. Bummer since I did like how my daughter sat in it and the features. Not sure if this was on the Summer company or Amazon but we just didn't have luck with this guy. Get what you paid for kind of situation or just rotten luck?

04/19/2023,United States,5,Rami,Amazing for the price!,"We bought this stroller over a year ago and kinda just bought it in a hurry for a trip we were taking by plane. For the price we mainly just hoped it would get us through the airport and last till we got home. Now it has been on 8 trips through the airport including being weighed down with multiple backpacks and getting gate checked each time. It has sat next to snowy east coast beaches, been up and down rocky Alaskan trails, and has done miles and miles on city sidewalks. During it's downtime it resides in the trunk of my car where it is usually smashed by a Costco box or jammed aside to make room for more kid stuff.Another handy feature is that it collapses very easily by using a foot on the latch then one hand to push the handles to the ground and it latches itself closed. At this point it can be carried in one hand while wresting a fit throwing toddler in the other arm or you can use one hand to push it along when your toddler is in a walking mood. Everytime we get this out to use it I'm amazed that it's still just plugging along.As far as reclining it is easily adjustable and ours has seen many stroller naps. Its not able to lean back super far but at least enough to where the kids head doesn't fall forward while sleeping.One small flaws is one of the snaps for the umbrella top broke early on so when the stroller is folded up it just kinda flops there but can be easily snapped back onto the frame each time.It seems obvious but I should also mention that the tires are definitely umbrella stroller tires.. they are not handy for off-roading.. We have done it, but yes it definitely makes for a rocky ride and I wouldn't suggest this as a off road stroller.Another couple details are that the fabric can be removed from the frame by unscrewing about 8 screws. It's a bit tedious but is handy for when the fabric needs to be washed due to a potty training accident. The straps are good and very adjustable it has fit as little as a 6 months old baby up to our three year old toddler and I think we still have more time with it.Anyway, we love this stroller and would 100% buy it again. Everyone should have this as a travel stroller that lives in the trunk.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD9LDZBNACH9D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07P1YSC18,20,B07P1YSC18,Color: Gray,

The fact that they are plastic instead of rubber did not help. I used this stroller one time. For 15 minutes in a store. Within the first minute of use I knew it was getting returned. I actually had to tip the stroller backward with the front wheels up to get it to move. PROS: Easy to put together, light weight, easy to fold.

The thing tips over as soon as you take baby out if you have any kind of weight on handle. It is not the easiest to maneuver and if you are tall (I’m 5’7”) you pretty much need to bend over to reach the handles. I mean it was cheap and we managed but seriously not a good choice.

When she is in it, the back of her head is right to the edge of the backing. This is concerning as I was hoping this would be good for at least one year of use but I believe she will out grow this in the next 6-9 months. The back is like an umbrella stroller that the seat is basically like a hammock no real back support just like a hammock. This is not an issue when the kid is awake but a bit uncomfortable for them when they fall asleep. Also when my daughter sits on it you can see the back wheels give a bit as if not able to support her weight.

Adjustments are easy. Glides smooth, wheels are grippy, has a little clearance for curbs, very lightweight. Excellent storage underneathe for how small it is.My only complaints, but which I assume are common to all strollers: 1) even in the upright position, there's some slouching (hasn't seemed to matter), 2) pushing stroller one-handed is difficult, 3) cupholders are too small.

They called me back and informed me that they would not provide a replacement nut and spacers, my three month warranty had expired, and my only solution was to buy another stroller despite the fact that is only five months old and broke due to poor manufacturing.I then found out that Summer Infant was bought by an Atlanta-based company called Kids2 in June 2022.

10/14/2022,United States,5,Dchiz,Better than expected,"I was a little worried after reading all the reviews but made the purchase anyway based on price. I wanted it to take on vacation with my toddler grandson because the one his parents have is too big and bulky and takes up too much room in the car. It arrived just before we left so we took it in the box and assembled it upon arrival at our vacation spot.It was easy to assemble, and based on reviews, we made sure we knew how the lock mechanism worked on the front wheels that keeps them either going straight or being able to turn freely. As others said, it WAS hard to engage the mechanism at first but honestly, we left them in the free position.The stroller was lightweight, easy to fold and easy to maneuver. We LOVED the built in zippered storage pouch with cup holders! Also, the canopy’s extra Sun visor was great for our little guy and there was plenty of airflow around him. Having storage underneath was an extra bonus for such an inexpensive stroller.The only thing that was at all a problem was the positioning of the vinyl footrest. It seemed to be at an awkward height so if he was using it, his knees were bent and up high - and if he extended his legs, they hung over the edge. Regardless, we loved the stroller. We used the stroller for 9 days, on concrete, on gravel, on grass - basically everywhere we went while in South Dakota. In fact, my daughter in law was so pleased with it that she ordered one as soon as we got home! She now keeps it in the car for regular use - and the big bulky stroller that was great for infants is now relegated to the garage ( for the next one ). And the one I bought stays at Nana and Papa’s house so we have it for any of the grandkids who are visiting.

Light shines through.Balance has improved, less likely to tip from behind with things hanging on handles.**Forward tipping hazard where backrest shoots forward when going down steep inclines. Strap them as tight as possible due to this, I can see a recall as it is NOT safe to go down forward inclines pitched further than 45 degrees or so. **Cup holder is great.Mechanism to fold has lost quality.I was still surprised the stroller was in this price range given inflation but instead they have cut down on the quality to keep the price point low. I will probably keep it due to it being a bargain but would recommend other options especially if this will be your go to stroller for travel.Please be mindful of the forward tipping hazard and make sure your babies are strapped tight!

This conversation happened on 8/24 and I sent the requested documentation as soon as we hung up the phone. Fast forward almost a month (9/15) and multiple attempts to reach Maddy again and I finally received an email stating my replacement had been shipped and when I receive it I was to cut the old ones straps so it would be unusable and send them photos of the damage I had done. Well, my answer to that is simply no, I am not about to destroy a perfectly good stroller. I have responded to her request stating as much and offering to return it if they'd like, I'm sure it'll be another month before I hear from them, if at all. Customer service with this company is shoddy at best and although I do like the stroller if I had it to do over again I wouldn't purchase from them. I'd honestly give the stroller 4.5 stars, it's a great little stroller, maneuverability could be a little better but other than that I really like it and so does my grandson.

09/07/2022,United States,3,cathy nilsson,Decent travel stroller,"I bought this stroller when looking for a good travel stroller. Overall, this worked out pretty well for those needs. It is lightweight and folds down fairly easy which were the biggest things I was looking for since I wanted it mostly for airport/travel use. Between this and the next model up, the main difference that was noted was the next model up came with a carrying strap, but it was $40 price increase. I felt like that was a big price increase for not a lot of added features. So instead of spending $40 for that, I bought a carrying strap separately for like $15 that just clipped on to this stroller when folded down and saved us a little money that way. It worked out perfect.The biggest downside is that the front wheels do not turn so the maneuverability is not as smooth as I’d have liked.

08/01/2022,United States,2,Melanie,Bought for travel - Not impressed,"I bought this stroller for my small toddler to bring with us on a family trip. I wanted something lightweight, cheap-ish but fairly sturdy, and easy to maneuver. I like to think I'm pretty easy to please and try to give the benefit of the doubt, but I can't really do it with this one.Granted, you get what you pay for, but if this is what I get for $50 I may as well have gone super cheap and bought a $15 stroller from Walmart or Target. It was like the same thing and I wouldn't have expected anything more.The front wheels barely touch the ground and won't move forward after I reversed or turned. I had to bend down and turn the wheels the correct way again to move forward or the stroller would get stuck. When a stroller can't perform the basic function of moving, it's crap no matter how many other good features it has.The detachable hood kept getting detached from the stroller so it would pop out all the time. I had to fasten it back on anytime I folded and unfolded the stroller. When I got it back from TSA after gate-checking it, the visor was completely bent out of shape - not sure if the blame is on TSA for that or the design of the stroller.The positive to this stroller was that it was super lightweight and easy to quickly fold down (if you had nothing inside of it), and it comes with a cupholder with extra zip storage.

08/01/2022,United States,3,Alexander K-y,Not extremely light or compact when folded. UPD: lopsided,"We bought this for out 2 year old to take on occasional trips when she is tired and needs a nap/ ride. the size is good for her, she is a tall toddler. i think we can definitely get another year out of it. the assembly was easy, just pop the wheels in and attach the hood. Seems to be good quality for the money. she likes the footrest, on our previous stroller that broke, it was basically non existent. the recline is minimal, maybe just a couple of inches, but i think will be enough for her age. I would NOT recommend this stroller for babies who are not confident sitters yet, the seat is soft - does not have the bones in it and the child needs to rely on their own posture/ back to sit straight up. i'd say it's good from maybe 8 months up, depending on the child's individual development. the built-in cargo bag is a nice feature. the storage at the bottom is pretty small but same goes for all folding strollers. the height is very comfortable for us, 5-7, 5-10 family. did not test the wheels on our New York roads yet, but they seem fine, not too small. handles well. the hood is generous size. overall very satisfied. One con is when folded, it's still pretty long (definitely will take the width of our trunk) and not super light. There's no good way to carry it when it's folded, ex. no shoulder handle etc. so it's not a super compact stroller for sure. UPDATE: after taking for a ride, turned out the stroller is way more flimsy that i thought. One wheel does not touch the ground, so the entire frame is slightly lopsided, it's super annoying that wheel is just going crazy by spinning freely and the stroller does not move smoothly because of that.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O4GO01N800GH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07P1YSC18,5,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

07/28/2022,United States,3,MBP,Mini low end version. For a very small child or baby.,Definitely mini. Photo compares a red average sized umbrella stroller to this mini stroller. My big 20lb baby fits nicely in it and I imagine he will grow out of it by 2 years old. It is too small for my averages sized 4 year old to sit in. Next time I would pay the extra money for the regular version. Non removable Cup holder nicely fits a bottle. A larger cup can easily spill. Zip storage space can hold a wallet but if not positioned correctly will cause the cups to spill out. The bottoms of the cup shares the same space. Fold very easily. Is very lightweight. Small under storage doesn’t hold much and is hard to access when reclined. Recline goes back a couple inches but is still in a sit up position. My Baby does not sleep well sitting up. Maneuvers fine but the plastic tires will not likely last long on city bumpy sidewalks. Seatbelt is easy to buckle. Overall it is a fine compact stroller for occasional use. Not an everyday stroller.

05/27/2022,United States,3,Jane Austin,Dirty wheels end up inside stroller when folded,"I wanted to like this stroller because it is lightweight with great maneuverability. Very nice-looking, nice cup holders, storage pouch and storage basket. It also fit easily into my car when folded.It’s easy to fold but unpleasant- you have to reach down to the exposed metal frame in the back, by the back wheels, and use your hand to pull it out and then push it up. The frame edges are sharp.I couldn’t get my 7-month old granddaughter strapped in because the hooks to detach the straps from the harness are very hard, rigid plastic. It took me a very long time to detach one, practicing in my living room, so that wouldn’t work out in the world. That was the deal-breaker.Another negative was the fact that when you fold the stroller, the wheels - and the dirt on them - end up right inside the canopy, and in close proximity to the seat back, which of course touches the child. I thought I could work around that by carrying a plastic bag to put over those wheels before putting the stroller away, if that had been the only thing I didn’t like. If you Google the stroller instructions to see how it folds up, you will see what I mean. Also, it doesn’t stand up when folded. If you lock the back wheels with the foot brakes, however, you can prop it against a wall or your car.When I found I couldn’t even get the straps over the baby’s shoulders because I couldn’t detach them to open them up completely, I decided to return it.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7AT42V48P9T5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07P1YSC18,1,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

It lasted about 18 months before the wheels started to get wobbly and the rubber/plastic footrest finally gave out.For our recent trip, I bought another one since my youngest is 4.5 and we only really needed it to travel and such. I noticed the quality wasn't as good, but I figured we'll be fine if I get 1 year out of it. The footrest busted in about 4 months and the wheels are already wobbly.I let the company know and was told that the warranty is only good for 90 days and The foot rest is not meant to be stood on at all, but is meant for the child to rest their feet on.Really? I wasn't supposed to have my child just stand on the footrest and just not use the seat to sit down? Figured I'd let people know about how much they stand behind their product.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614G95nGqhL._SY1600.jpg,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MZFWU7A6OJ5D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07P1YSC18,9,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

05/18/2022,United States,5,A. Rose,Great value for basic portable stroller,"It's a convenience stroller. Can't go wrong here. It's not top end, but for the $45 price tag it feels pretty darn well made. Easy to fold and unfold, light, takes up little space. Basket to hold some basics and I love the zip pocket and bottle holders for the adult. I bought this for a 2 week road trip with my 7 month old and it was money well spent. Much less space taken in the car than my big expensive jogging stroller, and it's small size was a plus for going into stores, restrooms, and gas stations. We even used it on rough gravel and dirt trails where it really didn't belong but it did ok. Since I've been home I've still been using this one more than my big stroller, it's just so easy. I'm happy with my purchase. And I love the blue color, a real bonus for me!Cons: the hood is too small, it's pretty useless. And the seat angle is just not quite right. I've tried all the adjustments but my baby looks a bit slumped and uncomfortable in it, although he hasn't complained so it must not be too bad for him. I wouldn't use it for super long periods of time. He's very tall for his age, but maybe when he's older it might fit better?

Other than that it works fine around the block and the color is nice and chic. Basket space is decent and the upper compartment for drinks is a nice plus.

It is small, does fit in the doors of a cruise cabin and is lightweight. Beyond that, it’s nothing “special”. The front wheels are stiff making it difficult to maneuver the stroller. While the seat does recline, it doesn’t lay back. So it’s not great for napping. And when you have the seat in an upright position it eventually sags into the reclined position.

When the stroller is sitting there, the wheels on one side don’t even touch the ground. It’s such a pain to maneuver. Sounds like plenty of folks have no issues so it seems like we just got a crappy defective one, and we don’t use it much so we are outside of the return window or it would be going back because it’s pretty much useless and harder to push than any other stroller me lol or my husband have used.

As a first time mom 2 years ago I bought the extravagant $500 stroller after weeks of research and comparisons.

It’s a pretty basic stroller but meets my needs- adequate underneath storage, cup holder for parents built in, decent sun shade, can recline a bit.CONS: one of the back wheels is stuck with the brake on- it seems to have broken somehow because when I release the brake, the back wheel still won’t spin. Super frustrating!!! I’ve only had it a month and used it about a dozen times.

08/24/2021,United States,4,I. Giron,"Great Light weight travel stroller, 3Dmini vs Kolcraft Cloud","I bought this stroller because I wanted a second light weight stroller for second vehicle. I also thought it may be better quality than our Kolcraft cloud stroller. Upon comparison this stroller has a larger basket, better safety harness, built in fabric drink holders, locking mechanism for front tires, a fabric adjuster for inclining the seat and maybe two more inches in height on the handles. The cons.. shade provided not as good as the Kolcraft, tires are a bit shorter, although a little bit wider, the seat may get got because of lack of air flow unlike Kolcraft which has a back that you can roll up which is great if you live in a very hot area because it allows for air flow, the locking mechanism in back seems a bit unsafe and could easily be accident pushed unlike the Kolcraft cloud. Overall, I like this item just as well as the Kolcraft but price point in better on the Kolcraft Cloud.

08/13/2021,United States,5,Lisa McRoberts,Perfect for traveling,"First of all, I was kind of skeptical about purchasing this stroller based on reviews that people had written about how the front wheels didn’t turn on their strollers, but there was one reviewer that said to unlock the wheels and it would maneuver just fine (I’m sorry I don’t remember who that was), so I made the purchase. I’ll admit, I didn’t figure out how to unlock the front wheels until we were through security at the airport, but I hadn’t tried it until then, and while it’s very simple, you do have to push down on the little lever tab kind of hard to get it to click. I was a little nervous I was going to break it because it’s not super substantial, but once it clicked I never re-locked the front wheels (back wheels also have locks).I specifically purchased this stroller for a trip to the mountains of Colorado with my 18-month old daughter. I was flying there to meet my parents and I wanted something smaller than the other two strollers we currently had because I was going to be in the airport by myself with my kid (plus luggage). This stroller met all of my needs and to my surprise was very resilient on crushed granite mountain roads! Now would my BoB or Vista have worked better? 100%, but the thought of having to gate check either of those strollers gave me so much anxiety. This $50 umbrella stroller is so worth the purchase, I can’t recommend it enough! I hope this helps someone make their decision.TL;DR: unlock the front wheels and this stroller will be your best friend while traveling.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MKGO7CSPDH0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07P1YSC18,51,B07P1YSC18,Color: Gray,

07/16/2021,United States,2,Kristen D.,"Very small age window of usability, get something that will last longer","Pros: super easy to fold and unfold, very light weight, takes up minimal space in the trunkCons: the front wheels do noy turn easily and our left front wheel basically doesn't even touch the ground for some reason, my son is still 10 lbs under the max, but he's outgrown the stroller, so he leans forward and his feet touch the ground so we sometimes have to tip it to the back 2 wheels so he doesn't drag his feet (main reason I'm in the market for a new stroller), the under basket is basically useless for anything larger or more structured than a sweatshirt because the crossbars that allow it to fold block the opening and it's tiny, the handles are short (I'm 5'6 and have to hunch forward, so pushing it for any extended period of time is uncomfortable, but it's perfect for my 12 yo to push as she's 5'1), the shoulder straps click into the crotch buckle, making it super easy for my son the pull his arms out which gives him way too much reach if we're in a store with breakables or something, and lastly, there's no snack tray available for this even to purchase separately, which makes keeping track of a snack cup and sippy more difficult.FINAL VERDICT: this would be a good stroller for maybe 6 months to 12 months and that's about it (I wouldn't go younger because while the seat does recline slightly, that puts the child resting on the crossbars which I can't imagine is comfortable).",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MXBNZB12FLXN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07P1YSC18,0,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

06/28/2021,United States,5,ELLE B.,Perfect lightweight stroller for a quick jaunt,"Got this stroller as a potential candidate for going to Disney. Both my husband and I have differing opinions on whether our kid will need it there at 5 and he didn’t want to bring down our larger stroller. However, this one isn’t as easy to steer, doesn’t have as much storage underneath and doesn’t have as much of a recline for napping as we would like as my thought is at Disney she will get tired and want to fall asleep in the stroller. So- perhaps not a Disney candidate.Here’s the good- I love that this stroller takes up a fraction of the space as the chicco bravo we have. It is easy to fold and unfold when you figure out how to do it, but it is awkward to fold compared to our one handed fold on the Chico Bravo. It also noticeably lighter.

This stroller doesn’t turn easily & the front wheels go all over the place making it hard to steer. I’m also not thrilled with the seating. It isn’t shaped the best to be sturdy. My 10 month grandson gets twisted even with the straps &harness tightened. I’m sure there’s a better stroller out there. I’ll keep looking...

It got us through the airport with ease and had no problems getting it through the security xray machines at TSA. I also loved the 2 cup holders and zippered pocket. The basket has minimal access so it can only be used for small items but that wasn't a problem cause my diaper bag has stroller straps.

04/21/2020,United States,4,Shannon Lojeski,Good price for a decent stroller,Hey everyone! If you’re looking for an affordable umbrella stroller this is a good fit!We’re heading to Nashville in July and currently own a big britex car seat. It was a little to large to want to deal with at an airport so I started to search for something smaller and lighter.Our britex feels as tho it is 40-50lbs when it is folding and lifting it into an SUV.This is maybe 5-8lbs it is very light.When fully put together I can lift it over head no problem beside it being top heavy.Once folded it is even easier to lift.A few things I noticed and did not like.The back of the seat isn’t very comfortable. The bars that lower and raise it from slightly laying down to sitting up stick out.Once laying down it is much better (does not fully recline)The pockets for the cups are pretty small and would be best for taller skinny cups no cups with handles.It definitely is better than the $24 ones at Walmart but I think over $40.00 is pushing its value.,,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7KLQZOB2KL1D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07P1YSC18,0,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

02/14/2020,United States,4,Sharon Lyn Hayes,Exactly what I expected,Nice stroller for the price.The original stroller came with the canopy unable to fully open because there was over stitching on one side. The seller reached out to me the day after I left a message. They don’t have individual canopies for this stroller so they had to send me a whole new stroller. It arrived quickly. I printed the return label and sent the original one back. Too easy!Our little guy is just turning 10 months and is 24 pounds. I have a Bob stroller but needed something quick and lightweight for errands. This stroller fits that need but nothing more. I wouldn’t want to have to push it a long distance or through the mall but it is great for a trip to our pediatrician’s office!Overall this stroller is exactly what I expected.

There’s no room to slide your had between the bottom of the seat, and into the basket storage area.The front wheels are kinda weird.

The minute I removed it from the box I could just feel and see what a cheap product this is. It's flimsy, they seat is so uncomfortable. My son didn't even want to be in it 5 min rolling around my living room. And even though it says reclining...it's a pull strap that brings it slightly up and down. It's very hard to close and the ride isn't smooth and effortless. I returned it and ended up spending the money on the Uppababy G Lite, which is amazing. This stroller, definitely not.

It help up well for our trip but it isn't sturdy enough for daily use in our neighborhood (lots of old brick sidewalks and cobbled streets). The only cons are the independent brakes (it's just an extra step to brake two different wheels) and the build quality (one of the four wheels on the front doesn't touch the ground and the canopy pops off on one side every time i folded it).

11/14/2019,United States,2,Heather L.,"Keep looking, don’t buy this one.","I’m not one to be picky and usually don’t mind a few minor inconveniences to save a buck, but this stroller is junk. The canopy won’t stay attached, always popping off the stroller. The front wheels have a locking feature to keep them from turning, but even when unlocked, they only turn sometimes. Most of the time you have to slide the stroller sideways. The wheels are so slick and made with the thinnest cheap plastic, it feels like running over a small rock might dent the wheel. The overall material is cheap and was not comfortable AT ALL for my baby. She was sliding down the whole time, and the buckle doesn’t fit snug or safe.

11/05/2019,United States,3,viraj,Lightweight but with some design issues,"Got this today. Once I assembled, it looked sturdy and it is super light. 2 things that bothered me areA) the front wheels do not rotate 360 degrees. They move sideways a bit but not like other strollers. This makes it less maneuvering.B) when I made my baby sit (22 lbs), I noticed that the outer wheel of the front sets on both legs no longer touched the ground and I can spin them freely. It looks like the baby weight bent the frame downwards in the middle that kind of moved the ends upwards and these outer wheels comes off the the ground. Now when I stroll her, I can see that these outer wheels do not move at all so it is only on inner set...is this a defective piece?

08/17/2019,United States,5,Chris,3D Mini compared to Graco TraveLite,"I ordered both the Graco and Summer 3D stroller. Here is my opinion on the Graco compared with the Summer.Graco has taller handles, great for taller people, not necessary for my husband and me since we are of average height.The storage bin is much more accessible and is larger on the Graco due to thefolding mechanism (see photos). I prefer the Graco when it comes to folding and unfolding, they have provided larger handles for those maneuvers. However the latch that keeps the stroller closed doesn’t keep the stroller as compact as it could be. Graco has provided a carrying handle mounted onto a side bar, a nice feature I think. The seat does recline, but certainly not suited for a baby under 6months. The straps are adjustable, but the Summer stroller allows for much more adjustable variations. Both strollers reclined with ease. One downside of the Graco strap: when unbuckled the over the shoulder straps don’t stay attached to the waist straps. This make for 2 issues. 1. The strap comfort pads slide off every time you unbuckle 2. You have to reattach these every time you want to buckle up the kiddo. I appreciated the Summer stroller in this aspect, the shoulder straps clip onto the waist straps. Allowing them to be removed, only when you so choose. I preferred the Graco cup holder over the Summer, because it’s removable and plastic. The Summer cup holder is made of material, it is flimsy, and not easily cleanable. The plus on the Summer stroller cup holder is that it has a zipper pouch for accessories, phone, etc. The Graco has a removable lap bar, while the Summer stroller does not offer this feature. They both seemed equally easy to push. The Graco has bigger wheels, making it easier to push through dirt and rocks. Overall the Summer Lite Stroller is smaller, more compact, and lighter. My husband ended up picking the Summer Lite Stroller due to its smaller size and he preferred its features over the Graco. We gifted the Graco to my 6ft tall sister and brother-in law who we thought would appreciate its larger/taller size.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AA4mO-3fL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AeKsoXtAL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VwC+hKWLL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zTKs2cLyL._SY1600.jpg",,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1T0OFB525LRHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07P1YSC18,560,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

It is longer than my old big stroller, so it doesn't fit back between the wheel wells in the trunk like I'd hoped, but generally takes up less space, which was the point. FYI, if you are having trouble opening it, you have to release the strap that is used to make the seat back go from a reclined position to an upright position.

06/30/2019,United States,5,Momof1,Super light and has a recline!,I have and love the 3D tote but wanted even lighter stroller. More of an umbrella stroller but with a recline for napping. I spent a really long time looking at lists reading reviews and comparing the few options for a light weight stroller with a recline . I was torn between this one (the Mini) and the Lite convenience but the Mini was on sale here and I'm so glad I went with this one.

06/25/2019,United States,5,Sean O.,The differences between this and the 3D Lite,"I just bought this Mini, as an upgrade from the cheap Cosco umbrella stroller from Target and Wal-Mart. I haven't used the Lite, but looking at the listing for it, it seems the main differences are:1) Folding mechanism. The way the Mini folds is similar to the basic Cosco, with a metal bar that hinges in the middle. The Lite appears to have a fancier mechanism, with a footstep and handle that you pull.2) Recline mechanism. The way the Mini reclines is by pulling a strap which tightens itself behind the fabric at the top area of the seat. Very simple. The Lite appears to have 2 red buttons on each side that you push to raise or lower the seatback into 3 set positions. Seems a bit more complicated, but also might operate a bit nicer? Certainly would contribute to the price difference at least.3) Built in carry strap. Mini doesn't have one. The Lite does.4) Cup holders. The mini has 2 in a piece of fabric that stretches between the handles. The Lite only has 1.5) Basket. Mini's basket seems a bit smaller and holds less than the Lite.6) Folded size. When folded, the Mini's wheels by the handle stick out a bit, takes up a bit more room. The Lite looks like it gets more compact.7) Weight. The Mini is about 2 lbs lighter than the Lite.Features that look the same, or nearly the same: Similar child size capacity, 5 point child harness, cushioned seat, 5 wheels, swivel front wheels that can lock into position, and have some shock absorption, a basket, shade and sun visor, good handle height and space to not keep stepping on wheels as you push.Conclusion: I'm happy with my purchase. I got the Mini on sale for $33. Compared to the $90 price for the Lite, I'm more than OK not having the few other features, they're not worth paying 3x as much. I just want a lightweight stroller that's easy to push, holds a few extra things plus my kid, and folds up small.

04/26/2019,United States,5,Amazon Customer,A lot of great features for the price!,"We bought this stroller for quick errands since our other strollers are a tad too bulky to be throwing in and out of the car all the time just for a short trip into a shop, bank, etc. So let’s start with assembly- it is very simple to put together, all you have to do is snap on the wheels, the parent console, and the canopy. This stroller is thin but fairly tall and lightweight. It folds/unfolds very easily and leaves a lot of extra room in your trunk when traveling. The wheels on this stroller swivel which makes it super easy to get around with. It has a great muti-angle recline to allow your child to sit up and sight see or lay down and take a nap. Another great quality of this stroller is that it has a storage bin at the bottom- not great for large items like big diaper bags since the bar gets in the way, but it’s great for smaller items. It comes with a great parent organizer for two drinks and a zipper pocket for phones, keys, chapstick, etc. The seat of the stroller is fairly narrow- but it’s a mini convenience stroller, it’s supposed to be that way! The canopy doesn’t come out super far, so it’s not great when the sun is out infront of you, but it works for when the sun is overhead. I’m 5’2 and my husband is 6’2 and we can both push this stroller comfortably. This stroller has a lot of great features for its low price and it definitely gets the job done!",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GUDHX2KPR7RE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07P1YSC18,10,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

04/20/2019,United States,2,Gen Marceau,Sun canopy is useless,"Granted for the price this is a good stroller, but its difficult to fold and unfold and the canopy pretty much becomes useless after you fold it up for the first time. The canopy is supposed to open up and cover my son, and since we live in Texas, a sun shade is vital. However, the other day I unfolded it for a doctor's appointment and the plastic canopy ribs are now suck in a V shape instead of the U shape that need to be, which means I can't fold the canopy up anymore. This was only the second time its been used and already one of the most important pieces is useless. This is a great stroller if you want something mobile and lightweight but DON'T need the sun canopy. I unfortunately will need to find something else.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKQ0U0QUWWGDT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07P1YSC18,2,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
04/18/2019,United States,5,Jason Sipp,Excellent stroller for traveling alone with a child in airports,"Bottom line: Purchased this stroller specifically to use in major airports and I’m very pleased with its design and performance. I highly recommend it if you’re traveling alone with a young child.What I needed: Because I regularly fly alone to visit family in a different state with my toddler, I needed a stroller that is lightweight, maneuverable with one hand, and easily collapses; I got my money’s worth with the Summer 3D mini!What I got: This stroller is compact and utilitarian while comfortable for my growing child. The handles are at a good height and angle to avoid wrist fatigue and the wheel distance is sufficient so I’m not always kicking it (I’m 5’5”). I was extremely pleased that I can push it with one hand - after a little practice - so I am able to pull my suitcase behind me and be self sufficient from the curb. You do need to reach down and use your hand to disengage the safety mechanism to fold the stroller, however it automatically locks into the folded position and easily unfolds with one hand (I just use my foot to secure it in the open position). For child security, it’s got an adjustable 5 point harness with padding that is simple to operate for an adult; I like the additional shoulder straps so the kid can’t reach forward and pull the stroller over. The double wheels are perfect for stability and maneuvering on any surface, even on a gravel hiking path in the rain!Perks: It comes with under seat storage, albeit minimal. The designer was smart and added a double drink holder that’s got a zipper compartment. The sunshade is detachable (DO remember to remove this before you gatecheck the stroller, it might pop off if the baggage handlers are rough with it!) and long enough to be useful at sunset/going uphill facing the sun. The seat reclines slightly to keep a sleeping child’s neck at a safe angle.My only frustration was figuring out why the front wheels weren’t moving properly, but this is actually a happy problem. Apparently, both the front and back wheels each have a way to lock each individual wheel in place so you kid doesn’t roll downhill. The front pair have a little switch to lock them that is often bumped when the stroller is folded and being handled by airport staff, but ultimately I’m glad they do lock so it’s a minor inconvenience.Why I love it: I HATE inefficiency and being stuck in airport security and this stroller helps me streamline my boarding process for a less stressful (I am flying with a toddler, let’s be realistic) traveling experience. I’ve flown with this stroller multiple times and both I and my child like it so much it’s now my go-to stroller for walks and shopping trips. I highly recommend the 3D mini: it’s durable, worth the money, and has all the features!",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRYWFO9Q2X5C8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07P1YSC18,657,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

They can't use the shoulder straps and sun shade obviously, but this was the best cheap option stroller for our 7 yo that we found and it didn't disappoint. Cup holders and zipper pouch were handy.The latch that holds it closed when folded is about 1 too long so it doesn't close as tight as you think it should when folded, but that can also be useful if you want to leave a raincoat or blanket in the net under the seat and still fold it up.If you're over 6ft tall you might wish the handles we're a couple inches longer, but that's literally every umbrella stroller.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15RZ8LJDIS2NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07P1YSC18,206,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

I have returned.The canopy sucks. I thought it would be a little useful…not at all. And on top of that, it kept popping off so I kept having to button it back on which was extremely annoying.Not all 4 wheels touch which is fine if you’re not on a flat surface but it sucks when you’re on a smooth surface (like concrete).The storage basket held our ergo baby carrier, that was about it.There is no recline, I don’t know why it says there is.

Once I put the wheels on I noticed the canopy was busted and could not be repaired. None the less I needed it for the next day. Then the first time I used it (on Clifton Hill in Niagara Falls) I found that the shoulder strap that attaches to the lap belt was broken so my son was strapped into the stroller and I was able to wiggle out on an extreme busy street! As you can imagine I was not impressed. I have now shipped the defective stroller back and to my dismay, I have to wait for it to reach somewhere in the USA before receiving my refund!

10/08/2022,Canada,3,Jennifer Tremblay,Great small and light stroller but...,"Very good stroller for foldability and lightweight. However, it's not squared correctly, so all four of the wheels never touch at the same time, only 2-3 at a time. The basket underneath is useful if a bit small, and the cupholder/top zip pocket is great for tissues and drinks, is standard sized (all of our water bottles fit in it, including the 360 cups). The seat seems comfortable, and can be adjusted to cant a bit backwards but not enough to sleep comfortably without a cover or something for baby to put their head on. The front bearings for the swivel feature are a bit gunked up and don't swivel as easily as in the beginning but we did some dirt road walks, maybe stay only on asphalt and concrete? Comfortable handles for the parents, they're the perfect height for me (5'1) but a bit on the low side for my husband (6'2). Would recommend as a second stroller (we have a big jogger type as a primary stroller) or for visiting the city (folds easily and quickly, and weighs next to nothing).",,,TRUE,,6,B07P1YSC18,Color: Gray,

Please save your money and look for a different stroller.Unfortunately the stroller isn't very well padded or structured. Toddler is really uncomfortable and hates being in it, for reference we use the uppababy but the stroller is obviously more bulky and heavier, but my toddler can stand being seated in it for several hours at a time.

I have other products from this brand and have loved them, so was shocked I didn’t like this one. The wheels don’t turn on the back so you physically have to lift the stroller to pivot. One side of the alignment is slightly higher and one of the wheels isn’t level with the ground. The most frustrating thing is collapsing it. It’s this tiny little button on the steel frame that you can’t even press with just your foot. You need to get down and use both hands. Impossible to collapse with sandals on in the summer. My kid also leans right out of it. The straps aren’t super restricting, which isn’t the best safety wise.

It is light weight and might have you 2nd guessing if it will stand up to daily use. With over 2 years (2 kids) use on it, it has proven to be a better stroller than our first impressions left us thinking it would be. We had another stroller that cost much more and we wanted to spend less on a 2nd one. As it turns out, this stroller saw much more use than originally planned. It's no moving closet it but it stores more than enough to go shopping, a few hours in the park or day trips. It folds and opens up very easily and proved to be quite stable. The brakes are not as strong as your other stroller but they did their job. This model does not feature a full decline for sleeping purposes (it stops at about a 45° angle) but neither of our kids seemed to have been bothered by that.Based on our experience, it has proven itself over time and I do not hesitate to recommend it.",,,FALSE,,0,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

09/29/2020,Canada,3,Kaz,It's all right.,"Reasonable quality for the price. It's a heavy for the form factor, due to the cheap steel tubing. Better materials like aluminum or graphite could probably get this well under ten pounds, but not for seventy dollars. It is probably no lighter or heavier than other umbrella strollers in this size and price range. Wheels don't track on a level surface properly. Front leftmost wheel and rear rightmost often do not spin, causing uneven tire wear. The sun shade is a bit of a joke. When folded, the stroller is quite long; it will not lie flat in the trunk of my compact car. This is actually quite a silly design because even though the unit is made from three short sections (back/handle tubes, front wheel tubes, rear wheel tubes), when you fold it, the rear wheel tubes and handle tubes align end-to-end to form a straight line, causing the folded unit to be as long as it can possibly be. The handles are not adjustable, but due to their curved shape and vertical orientation, a 6'1 and a 5'2 person can grip this with equal comfort while maintaining a good posture, which is a big plus. The kid likes it. When going out, he points to the new stroller to say he wants to ride it instead of the big stroller, so this is kid approved. it. He loves to buckle himself these days, and it's easy to do with this stroller: it has a five point system, but with the shoulder points being attached by a kind of accessory hook, so the shoulder straps do not detach from the hip straps when the buckle is unlatched. That means it has the ease of buckling and unbuckling of a three point system.",,,TRUE,,0,B07SRVB6T6,Color: Pink/Black,
09/28/2020,Canada,4,Lk,It's alright but needs some work,"I really wanted to love this stroller but it has a few things that should be worked on. The back is very wavy/uneven, I find it really floppy almost? You can straighten it up a bit but it just goes back. Wish it was even and flat with padding. I don't like the fact you have to release the seat yourself in order for it to recline and how you have to pinch the clasp while pushing it upright to be in seating position. For the price of the stroller sure maybe it's ok but still kind of a pain. I do however love how easy it is to fold compared to the 3D lite. There should be a carrying strap on the side also. Unfortunately returning it because I preferred the lite better even though it's more complicated to close. 4 stars only because I can close it within 3 seconds which is convenient.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61edRF5GJOL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HaszgLJDL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WgjKYbztL._SY1600.jpg",,TRUE,,9,B07SRVB6T6,Color: Pink/Black,

Her heavier stroller is in my vehicle all the time and its annoying to take it out for walks plus she still uses her baby carseat attached to it. Only thing i find about this the wheels are not good quality its ok for road walks and flat grass. One of the front left wheels is not touching the ground when im strolling the rest all roll ok.

The storage space could be better. Not big enough to hold my purse for easy access (I would really need to jam it in).3. The sun canopy looks like it should extend further based on the amount of material left by only goes so far. Your babe may need some sunglasses until they get tall enough for the visor portion to be effective.All in all I think it's great for the price point.

I like the attached cup holder and pouch, I wouldn’t use it for tall cups but would more then hold a kids cup and water bottle. The zipper pouch will be very handy for keys/phone and other small items we need for little ones. The sun cover fits great onto stroller, way better then our Phil & Ted jogger stroller. Overall considering the affordable price this stroller meets n exceeds my expectations. My one critsim is the hinge release to fold. I couldn’t close it by hand or toes.

01/29/2020,Canada,5,Shelbs,Great umbrella stroller for price,This umbrella stroller is great compared to the basic strollers you buy at Walmart or Toys R Us. This one at least has storage under the seat. It has cup holders but I don’t think I will use them unless it’s something I can close completely. It can’t be a hard cup holder because it needs to be able to fold but it’s nice there’s a zipper compartment with the cup holders. I have used it once and it worked great. The only downside is the “recliner” is like a tether you loosen and tighten. And the seat seems looser to me but I think I might just be used to the basic one we had for our daughter that was not as good as this one. I like that it has a locking mechanism to hold the stroller together when it’s folded. The basic ones don’t. The storage under the seat is small like some of the other reviews said but I didn’t expect much for a more compact stroller. It holds our change mat and a smaller purse if needed. I’m happy I spent the extra money for this one instead of buying another basic one.,,,TRUE,,0,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
01/28/2020,Canada,5,Amazon Customer,Worth the money,"Been using it for over 4 months and it has stood up to its expectation. Light weight to carry, fold and put it up in the trunk.

It is not super easy to fold/unfold compared to other strollers as well as when it is folded it is very long.

09/07/2019,Canada,4,Tiphanie & Luigi Salfi,"Compact, lightweight, and easy to use!","This stroller works pretty much as advertised. It's lightweight and easy to open and close. It was off balance, so when we first started using it one of the wheels didn't touch the ground. That has changed as our child gets heavier. The sun shade gives better coverage than our big Graco stroller - pretty awesome. The recline is good enough for a lightweight travel stroller for my child to have a nap - something that lightweight strollers aren't known to have.The only issues I really have are that the sun shade is supposed to fold up with the stroller but it does not - half of it needs to be reattached everytime we set it up for use.Another issue is the harness. I have not figured out how to tighten the straps without tying the ends into a knot in the back of the stroller. It is not easily adjustable though we have worked out a system with ours.Final issue is storage. There are small pockets for essentials, and bring a compact lightweight unit, I understand something's gotta give, but there is no storage under the stroller. The basket underneath is pretty pointless unless you have alot of small items and can survive without a diaper bag. Because the stroller is so compact, during most items between the bars and into that little basket is hard, and it is not meant to carry much weight so be prepared to carry a backpack of essentials as you will need them!",,,TRUE,,0,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

THE SAME ISSUE. The front right wheel does not touch the ground so now I am thinking this is a product defect.

Most come with one of those plastic things screwed into the frame that seem so easy to break off.

08/05/2019,Canada,5,Sewist and the Geek,Bought for my grandson,"I take care of my grandson quite a bit and we love to go out and see the city, travelling mostly by bus and metro. His daily carriage was way too bulky and awkward for me to manage up and down metro stairs and carrying this big boy (almost 30lbs) is not really convenient. So I set out to find a stroller that would allow me to travel around the city with him without having to set out a course only visiting stations with elevators.The first stroller I bought was not suitable, it was good but the handles were way too low, even for me at 5ft 1. So after a little research I decided on this stroller and I am so happy I did.The handles on this stroller are high enough for me to comfortably push for hours, the baby loves it as it gives him full view of everything going on and interact with the dogs we pass on our daily outings. There is also space for his water bottle and underneath for a toy or two, snacks, my wallet and my phone. The umbrella is really great because of the added flap that helps prevent direct sunlight for getting into the baby's eyes.I like the way this folds up and locks instantly. No fussing for me to find the lock trigger and it fits snuggly in my front closet. It is very lightweight and I can easily fold it up at any stairs and carry the baby and the stroller up (or down) without issue.The only thing is for sleeping, when the baby falls asleep it looks so uncomfortable to me. I would like if it could be laid back a little more, that would be the only thing I would change.I highly recommend this stroller to parents and grandparents alike. :)",,,TRUE,,6,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

05/04/2019,Canada,4,Hannah M,Great Stroller,"Purchased this stroller for my 4.5 month old daughter. Assembly was reasonably straightforward, however the manual was folded up inside the stroller and I could have used some instruction on how to unfold it to actually get to the manual. It's super easy to get in and out of the car and really easy to fold and unfold. I like that it has a reclining seat and a 5 point harness with strap covers. The cup holder and pack are a nice feature and are perfect for keys, a phone and a wallet. The sunshade issues others have talked about must have been fixed as I have not had an issue whilst folding/unfolding.Cons to this stroller are: The basket is not worth much as it's ridiculously tiny and hard to access, but it's there nonetheless. The front wheels don't always touch the ground completely which I don't love.

As my little one got older, i got this Summer Infant 3D mini stroller because I wanted something lightweight and compact.What I like:-It’s really light and much more compact.-My toddler sits a lot more upright in this vs the CitySelect.-It comes with a storage pouch and cup holders so no extra cost needed to buy that.-It’s very easy to fold down and unfoldMy dislikes:-The bottom storage basket is very small-The wheels are foam and I already see quite a bit of wear and tear on them (after a month of outdoor use )-The wheels don’t all contact the ground at the same time. Depending on how my daughter is sitting, one of the front wheels will barely touch the ground.My Conclusion:Yes, it would be nice to have a peek-a-boo window in the sunshade or a one switch break system but that would add to the cost. All in all I’m really happy with this stroller. It’s at a great price point and provides all you really need for a toddlers daily stroller.This stroller maneuvers well in tight spaces. I would suggest that you only use it on side walks and inside malls as I don’t believe the tires would last long on rough terrain.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cW6w-gtFL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mMVdN+gWL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tMInfyN5L._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ePgXE3bvL._SY1600.jpg",,FALSE,,16,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

03/08/2019,Canada,4,J.B.81,Good secondary stroller. Frees up lots of trunk space.,"Purchased this stroller as a lightweight alternative for a trip. Our regular stroller is much bulkier and takes up way more trunk space so we needed something smaller for airports, theme parks, etc...I also really wanted one that has a basket to throw small things into and that is why I chose this particular stroller. It turned out to be pretty easy to put together. It also folds up much smaller than our primary stroller so it frees up a lot of trunk space. It is also relatively light so it is easy put in and out of the trunk, carry around, etc...My only warning is that this really is a 'convenience' stroller. It feels flimsier than I am used to. So it isn't a stroller I would be comfortable taking on very long walks or out in the rain, etc...It is good to throw in the trunk with suitcases or shopping. It is good for a walk through the mall or airport. I wouldn't be comfortable taking it for walks on gravel or mulched park paths or on long excursions around the city. So if you need a second, lightweight stroller this is a great choice. It isn't really sturdy enough to be a hardworking, primary stroller.",,,TRUE,,37,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

The box actually had never been opened and everything was there and easy to assemble. Not to mention very lightweight and compact. I'm looking forward to using this on our upcoming trip. The only negative that I would have to say would be the area under the stroller to store things isn't very large.,,,TRUE,,0,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
03/03/2019,Canada,5,Kay,Amazing stroller to travel with!!,"I bought this stroller in anticipation of our trip to Mexico. We needed something lightweight for our 15 month old that wasnt going to be a hassle to carry, push, store items, unfold, fold up.I was not disappointed. This was the BEST stroller for the money spent.It folds up so nicely and easily. When you're ready to put the kid in it's an easy unfold and you're done. My kid enjoyed being in it when we were strolling around the resort.The bottom storgare compartment looks small but we were able to fit our sandals, lotions, snacks, 2 beach towels and hats in there. I love that the handles are separate (not a single bar across), because we found it useful to hook my backpack and the kids water wings onto when our compartment was full. We literally threw everything we needed for the morning/afternoon onto and into this stroller.The down fall I can see for some parents is that the back doesn't recline flat, it's about a 45 degree. My kid didnt mind, he fell asleep.Other than that, its super light weight, easy to use, and has many storage options!",,,TRUE,,62,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
03/01/2019,Canada,3,Katelyn Steen,Brakes very easy,when I first got this stroller I loved it. I have now gone through 2 in 8 months. This is a secondary stroller so it’s not even used that often. Very disappointed...,,,TRUE,,0,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

02/16/2019,Canada,5,Abby,Very good value,"I was quite impressed with the quality and features of this stroller for its price. I didn't think it's very comfy for sitting there long as the back is soft but I'm getting it as a travel stroller so that's fine. It has all I need - kinda light weight, foldable, some storage, adjustable seat and cup holders. Nothing to complain about its value although price dropped 25% right after I ordered LOL",,,TRUE,,12,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
02/08/2019,Canada,4,Tom bunclark,Great price for what you get.,"It's very light weight, can close with one hand. Great for going shopping, can still fit groceries in with it. It is small, so even my 11 month old daughter had her legs hanging off the front. All in all it's great for the price and it's way easier than lugging a bigger one around.",,,TRUE,,0,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
01/23/2019,Canada,4,icemanbob,A few things to consider before buying,"This is pretty awesome! It's feature-packed and very useful.Pros:+ cupholder is great, many 'umbrella' strollers don't have something like this at all+ folds up well+ lightweight, about 11 pounds (not as light as the minimalist umbrella strollers we've had before)+ sun shield is a great add+ little bottom-mounted pouch is perfect for a small diaper bagCons:- as with many umbrella strollers, the wheels are not high quality; the locks are sort of cheap, especially the front wheel rotation locks which sound like they are breaking when we click them off- the wheels are basically a hard polymer material that's very barely squishy to the touch, not as good as a rubber tire- the seat adjustment strap on the back of the seat is very difficult to adjust, even without a kid in there- the handles are not height-adjustable; I have a couple of herniated discs, and I'm only 5'11, for me to be bent over pushing forever is painful; given this, and my long stride, I also frequently kick the back of the stroller which is also really aggravating- also with many strollers, a two-handled approach means you can't push with one hand, at least not very well or without strugglingI wouldn't buy this again, I'd put up with the pain of paying some extra for adjustable handles at the very least.",,,FALSE,,6,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
01/01/2019,Canada,3,Kris B.,just another umbrella,"This is our third stroller in the Summer Infant 3D line -- and of the three, this is the only one I'd say is nothing more than an umbrella stroller.For its price, I expected much more... and I can't recommend purchasing this over the $20 special from one of the big-box baby stores.",,,FALSE,,0,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
12/30/2018,Canada,5,Mr. Fahrenheit,"Deluxe umbrella stroller simple assembly, easy storage.","Out of the box this stroller took 5 mins to assemble without the instructions that were hidden in the stroller. The bonnet is very long and wide giving it great coverage and it clips on which makes it very simple to remove on days you don' need it. The wheels are very similar to other umbrella strollers I've had but the front ones have direction locks. The handles are nicely padded and there's two cup holders and a zippered pouch for storage. The five-point harness is easy to operate and fully adjustable too. Overall, I really like it and it's very well designed. It has one flaw and that's the same flaw as any umbrella stroller; it's a pain in the winter if you encounter much snow.",,,FALSE,,1,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
12/29/2018,Canada,4,REX,A very light and inexpensive stroller.,"This stroller has great value to cost ratio. It’s very light and compact, light enough for most people to carry around and when folded small enough to fit into very small spaces. If you have limited space or weight considerations this stroller may be exactly what you are looking for.This is the stroller I use when I am running an indoor errand, or in situations where I need to carry the stroller more than usual. It’s great for malls, or any other place that has a smooth surface. The wheels are not meant to be used on very rough or uneven surfaces, I use another stroller in those situations. When on a smooth surface this stroller moves very easily with minimal effort, the lightweight design really pays off in this situation.Other aspects of this stroller that I like is the drink holders that are great for carrying bottles, and coffee! :) There is a decent amount of storage, but I would not weigh it down with anything very heavy. The adjustable safety belt and padded seat are of decent quality. The sunshade and visor are extremely helpful, being able reduce unwanted light is a must.Overall it’s a decent stroller that is best for shorter outings on smooth surfaces, and in situations where weight size and space are the most important considerations.",,,FALSE,,0,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

12/27/2018,Canada,5,thychubbz,Very compact umbrella stroller,"This stroller is great for people that don't have a lot of space, especially in their trunk. This stroller folds up like an umbrella, and is surprisingly compact. It does not take up much space, perfect for storing in your trunk. The price is great too, every grandparent should have one of these in their trunk.Being a compact stroller doesn't mean that you have to sacrifice features either. I was really impressed with the sunshade with the integrated sun visor for those extra sunny days. You even get two cup holders at the back, perfect for bottles or two coffee cups.Overall, this is a great stroller that folds up well. You don't sacrifice any major features, everything you want is included.",,,FALSE,,1,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
12/22/2018,Canada,4,Dana,"Standard lightweight stroller, needs adjustable handle","Lightweight stroller that fits an older child comfortably. Pull down sun visor is a nice addition to the canopy for when the sun is lower in the sky.Favourite feature is the ability to lay the child back when they're sleeping, runner-up is double cup holders that are flexible and deep so I can carry coffee and put my cell in the other. I also love the bottom cargo area for my purse when we're in the mall.Least favourite feature is non-adjustable handles, which are a smidge too low to be comfortable for long walks if you're tall, and not so easy to carry one handed in a pinch.",,,FALSE,,4,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
12/22/2018,Canada,4,Luke,"Easy to Set-up, Quick to Fold and Put Away and More Premium than other Umbrella Strollers","Arrives in a long, slender box and frustration-free packaging. The only things needed to be done to set-up is to take off a few styrofoam ends from the metal edges, unfold the frame and pop the wheels into place. All done within 2 minutes. It's also very easy and quick for fold back down. For an umbrella stroller, this is really well built and sturdy. It features a complete seat belt that will hold the child more comfortably. It's got two cup holders and a big pocket, as well as a compartment below for bigger items. It's got easy to use and access foot brakes on the back wheels. The wheels also look more durable than on other umbrella strollers. The only complaint is that the front wheels sometimes get a little jammed and don't go exactly where you want them. That can be remedied easily by turning the around, which resets it. This is a more premium stroller than most other convenience strollers out there.",,,FALSE,,2,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
12/21/2018,Canada,4,Crystal A,Portable and Decent,"This Stroller is easy to put together (pending instructions are followed), and easy for the baby on the go.It's definitely a lot lighter than the huge strollers I typically see, and it's easy to navigate on flat surfaces (not so great on uneven surfaces due to the smaller wheel size).It includes a fabric holder for bottles and little items, such as your wallet - but nothing too big or weighty, as the holder tends to sag with too much weight.The seat is slightly padded, and includes a basic seatbelt to hold my niece in without her toppling out.There is a slight recline to the seat, just enough for a sit up nap.It folds up easily and fits in the back of our car without taking up much room at all.It's a basic stroller, but perfect for every day normal-person needs.",,,FALSE,,1,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,

It is easy to put together, great price point, and relatively good quality. I like the hood and the large storage area to make shopping easy. At this point, I don't have anything negative to say about it, but will update this review as needed if something breaks or isn't working properly.",,,FALSE,,1,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
12/19/2018,Canada,4,Krm,Light cheap easy to open and close,A lot of great things about this stroller. It comes nearly assembled all you have to do is click on the wheels and the sunshade. It is super lightweight and folds up small about 1/2 the size of a bag of golf clubs. Decent amount of storage and two cup holders are nice. Adjustable buckles so you can grow in it. My only complaint was that one of the wheels was melted/deformed a little. It doesn't affect the stroller much though since there each wheel consists of 2 wheels side by side and the one beside the deformed one still works fine. When you're all done it easily folds down with one click to toss in the car,,,FALSE,,1,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
12/17/2018,Canada,5,IamMe,Travel stroller,"This is a pretty good umbrella stroller for a great pricepoint.Really easy to put together - it arrives with the wheels off but you just need to click them into place. My 1.5yr old is able to climb into the stroller by herself. It can comfortably seat my 3.5yr old as well though steering is obviously a little harder with my bigger kiddo. The wheels are plastic so there is no worry about flat tires. It comes with a sun hood which is great, and it does have a small basket underneath where you can put a small diaper bag. There is also a cup/bottle holder!This stroller is perfect for airports and such. It obviously wouldn't be as comfortable as a regular stroller for all day pushing especially if you are tall, but for trips where you just need an easy compact stroller this one is awesome!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LTmI033ZL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PABgxdtbL._SY1600.jpg",,FALSE,,13,B07GGHVL64,Color: Blue,
