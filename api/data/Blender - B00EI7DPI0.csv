03/21/2023,United States,2,F. Parker,Ok blender,"Let me start off by saying that I will never buy anything from Hamilton Beach anymore!!!! Why? Because they offer no instructions manual in their products anymore. I contacted them in reference to this and they told me that they only offer downloadable instructions that you could print off. I told them that I was disabled and I don't have the means to do that. They sent me to someone else within the company and I explained my circumstances and I said not all people have highly efficient printers who can print off 39 plus pages of instructions and I asked for a booklet. I didn't even get a response from these folks who were supposed to be at a higher level than the people I was speaking with the first time. I got nothing. I do have an old printer that will print about 2 pages before it jams but no way could this printer I have print 39 pages off. It is not that modern of a printer and I live on Social Security Disability making only 19k a year so I don't have the money to invest in modern technology of the day when I barely have enough money to buy food. I bought a blender so I could mix up protein drinks to live off of. Do I recommend anything from Hamilton Beach, absolutely not 🚫. I can't lie and say that the blender doesn't work because it does. After I spilled everything all over my kitchen because I had no instructions on how to work it, I finally figured it out. It works okay. I did try to crush some ice and it didn't crush all of it and again I don't know if was my error or the blender because I have no instructions. All I can say is that it is an okay blender and I wish I had some instructions so I could follow some troubleshooting steps. If you got the high technology in your house and can do these things, then it might be worth it to buy a Hamilton Beach product but not for me anymore, 😠",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKHV0GG93GWXD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,0,,

Easy to clean: just blend soapy water after use and it cleans right up later. All around, I’m pleased with my purchase.I use this blender mostly for sauces and soups, and smoothies and milkshakes.Only reasons I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5: it does crush ice but takes a long time; it’s kind of loud; the plastic lid doesn’t fit very well and the vent in the top of the lid always gaps open, so I have to put a towel over the lid and hold it in place while using it to prevent splatters on the ceiling.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S2AFVGI8L9SZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,24,,

01/13/2023,United States,1,Regina Phalange,Lasted less than 2 years - bought in March 2021,"Average low-end blender. Worked okay for less than 2 years with a lot of maneuvering the blending in stages to get it to smooth everything, then the blender replacement cutter assembly (which ends up costing $25 with shipping and tax to replace from the Hamilton Beach website) seized up and got stuck and would barely turn. My engineer husband was able to take it apart and lubricate it and it's working again, but overall this blender is just average or worse. We tend to go through these types of blenders about every 2 years in different brands in the $40 range.

01/05/2023,United States,2,CT Philly,No creamy smoothie,"After years of using another brand, I thought I’d try this one. Plus, it was inexpensive. However, I did not like much about it. Bottom line I’ve been making smoothies every day for many years on my previous blender, this different brand may have struggled with the under powered motor, but it always gave me a creamy smoothie. I make it with almond milk, protein powder, frozen fruit, and bananas, and coconut cream, all of which made a creamy smoothie. Not with the Hamilton beach. Not enough blade action tried every which way just came out blended but no creaminess more icy.

The side of the glass bottle have measurements on them, so that's helpful so I don't have to get a measuring cup dirty.

   I am very big on using glass and refraining from plastics, as I had health scare recently, and was delighted to learn that this particular blender takes Mason Jars! I started to make daily protein shakes for my workouts - it's super easy! I start with my dry ingredients (protein powder, cinnamon, beta alanine, glutamine, collagen peptides) - then I add my watery ingredients such as Almond milk, and a splash of lemon juice. Now I insert the blade inside the cup, and twist tight the black converter - at this point you gently insert the whole thing into the base, NO TWISTING! And gently hit the smoothie button (warning don't use the Milkshake button or your shake won't be smooth!). In less than a minute you got a deliciously smooth protein shake!!! It works better than my Nutri Bullet! Then, come with me for the green smoothie test! Enter cinnamon and ginger, cucumber, celery, kale, spinach, avocado and lettuce + water. Hit smoothie, follow up with crush ice, which is a pulse setting, at the very end. Voila! Green smoothie is ready, and I honestly doubted it would be able to do it. I thought I'd need an expensive Vitamix - no sir! Worked well enough for my needs, and I'm happy with it. As far as noice levels, it's lower than my NutriBullet, and doesn't stink like something's burning or leech plastics into my drinks. So I kissed NutriBullet goodbye and replaced it with this little beast. Now for the cleanup!!! The best part! With NutriBullet the plastic cups stunk so bad after my protein shake, I had to soak them in vinegar every night! With this thing, I am rotating so many Mason jars (regular mouth), it's unbelievable! Also washing them takes seconds - no smells, no soaking, no chemical poisoning nonsense! Because plastics are so bad for our health, and this Little Blender is capable of big things !!! I am very satisfied.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MQ9FlRzwL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71VGRHlo4CL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Bc7jYsuQL._SY1600.jpg",,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8MMZUIIO43D5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,50,,

It did not crush ice, even when the ice added was already crushed, and certainly did not blend anything smoothly.

Did you know that broccoli is in the same veg family as well? And Cabbage. And Brussel Sprouts. But the kale we all know about is the hearty, fast growing plant. My mom and I had a hobby of planting these in our backyard. It produces leaves in the first year, and later in the first year or sometimes the next it will grow a flower stalk.

On a positive note, it works with fresh fruit and veggies, on a negative note, it you use frozen fruit like we do, it's a dud. The blades would not spin and it locked up. I had to dig everything out of the blender and just feed everything in slowly...one ingredient at a time. ( I really miss our old Ninja...) So, if you just want a inexpensive blender to do light work, buy it. If you need some extra juice for your juice, spend some more money on a more powerful blender. Oh!

07/12/2022,United States,3,Derek Evans,Average Blender,"Does this blender blend? Yes and no. The worst part of this blender is the very narrow area where the blades are. If you are looking to crush ice as the title of the product suggests, good luck. Best situation, you push the ice down with the other items you want to blend or blend the ice inside of a liquid. Without anything helping the ice move in the blender the ice will just bounce against the blade for a few minutes before, 'maybe', crushing. Additionally, if you have enough thick liquids or frozen items this blender cannot blend all the way through. I add frozen strawberries, yogurt, milk, and fresh bananas to this thing and the bottom 50% mixes and the top half just sits there.I have used this blender for a year, almost daily for a few months and it does work.

06/22/2022,United States,3,J.L.,"For the price, not bad, but underpowered for me","Received this as a gift after owning a Ninja 1500W, which itself is no BlendTec/Vitamix. Unfortunately this Blender struggles with even watered-down smoothies and some frozen fruit. That's because this blender is actually 700W PEAK power, which basically means that's the power when the blender initially turns on and them plummets. If it runs continuously at that load, it will burn up. Mine routinely starts bogging down (again pitcher full of lukewarm water and no ice added) and you can tell the motor won't last. Looking at the specs of the motor itself on the base, it says 120V/3.7A; that means it's actually a 450W continuous motor.If you're blending lighter stuff and a little more patient then I think it could maybe work. The interlocking mechanism with the base feels nice. The glass pitcher is nice. The lid, however, fits WAY too snuggly on the top that I who crank out forearm and finger exercises struggle. I can't imagine a nice old granny trying to pry the lid off...Not saying you need to go with the $400+ models, but find something with at least double the wattage, I'd say.

06/08/2022,United States,4,My experiences,It works well as a blender - not a food processor substitute,"This isn't a Vitamix by any stretch of the imagination. But it's I think it's a decent value for the price. Where else can you get a 40oz 5 speed blender with a glass pitcher for under $40 USD? I picked this blender for a couple of reasons1. The previous blender I had for over 15 years was a Hamilton Beach2. The toaster I have is also a Hamilton Beach, which I’ve had for over 20 years.Do I like it? I think so...Short recap of below1. For a sub $50.00 blender I like it. It works well2. I really like the (heavy) glass pitcher. This is the main reason why I purchased it.3. I like the base (motor) it feels solid, and it works very well4. It’s quieter than my old Hamilton Beach blender, which is my only point of reference. For me that’s good.5. The button feel very similar to my old blender which lasted a long time, so that too is good.6. I REALLY don’t like how hard the top is to remove7. I don’t like the cheap feel of the plastic bits attached to the pitcherWhat I like1. I like the glass pitcher - yes it's heavy but it's also made of glass thick enough to withstand crushing ice relatively quietly. Plastic pitches sound like they may shatter in the process.2. I like that the bottom screws off making the pitcher and blades easy to clean.3. I like the several blending options (though I use the two pulses more than the other 3 options).4. It makes a great smoothie & crushed ice drinks such as Margarita or Daiquiri very quickly and evenly blended.5. Worked great for making pesto & Harissa too, though the parsley had to be added in a bit at a time to ensure smooth consistency. I typically make these two items in my Cuisinart Food Processor which performs both of the above tasks in about 1/3 of the time it took in the blender. The consistency is also better in my Cuisinart. I figured I’d give the blender a go on these just as a test. I’m not gonna try making peanut butter.6. The base and mechanical bits under the pitcher have a quality feel for the price sub $50.00 price tag. The blender stays put, and a hand isn’t required on top of the blender to keep the pitcher from walking off the spinny bits.What I'm on the fence (can’t decide) aboutit's not particularly quiet - but quieter than my old blender, and definitely NOT quieter than my Cuisinart Food Processor. So I’m on the fence.What I don't like, and I mean really don't likeThe top is made of LDPE plastic making it extremely hard to get off when at room temp and especially straight out of the fridge. I’m not being a wimp; the top is extremely hard to get off. So hard I'm afraid the lifting tab is going to snap off in my attempts. My wife gave up getting the lid off and leaves it for me to struggle with.I don’t even try anymore to get the lid off if its cold. I run the whole pitcher under really hot water before I attempt to get the lid off. The hot water makes the LDPE plastic top pliable, making it easier to remove. Effortless is not be a synonym I’d use to describe removing the lid from the pitcher.This would be a deal breaker for a person with disabilities, Arthritis, weak fingers, and/or an elderly person. There is now way my Mom wouldn’t be able to get the lid off this blender.What I mildly don't like1. The top has a secondary flap, for what I’m not sure. The flap doesn’t have a proper hinge. The hinge is molded into the lid of the pitcher. Being made of LDPE plastic, I'm pretty confident it's going to snap off in time.2. The whole top / lid to the pitcher has a ton of nooks and crannies making it a challenge to clean quickly. A brush and soaking in hot soapy water is what works for me. I use it every day, so I wash by hand instead of using the dishwasher.3. The base that holds the blades onto the pitcher is made of thin ABS plastic which I’m quite certain if the base came into contact with counter top at an angle with a bit of force, aka dropping the pitcher onto the base or inadvertently smacked against the edge of the counter it will result in a broken base.. Maybe shatter would be a better termThose are my thoughts and experiences with this pitcher – You decide.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EMCSD8O6LMD5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,225,,

I know how to use a blender and prepare the fruit. My old, moderately-priced Hamilton Beach one that I am replacing after maybe 15 years worked beautifully in fraction of the time.Also the top is a poor design and made of cheap materials. Hard to pry off so will most probably wear out or crack. Don’t need the spout & will probably leak or wear out.The motor is not too noisy. And the glass jar seems sturdy.

   Complete waste of money. I don’t even fill it all the way and it doesn’t blend as you can see in the video. All I put in here is frozen fruit, sliced banana, and some almond milk. It takes me about 15-20 minutes to make a smoothie/açaí bowl which is the reason why I bought this, to make those two things. I have to manually stir and stab everything in the blender to get it into a perfect position so the blade grabs everything and blends the ingredients. Once I put everything in, I’ll hit one of the buttons and nothing happens so I have to take the lid off, mess with everything inside and press the button again. I repeat this give or take 10 different times just so the blender can do it’s job. Smoothies are supposed to be made within seconds but this takes up so much time — it’s not worth it at all.

There are pros and cons to this blender that I will go through. Starting with the pros, this blender is made of quality materials. The glass is thick and strong, I have dropped it in the sink before and the glass did not chip or break. Now to the less satisfactory part of this blender, the blades just don’t do their job well. Even when making a milkshake I have to thaw the ice cream until it is pretty much liquid for the blade to be able to turn the ice cream. When making smoothies and attempting to blend frozen fruit the motor sounds like it’s dying and it is not able to blend the frozen fruit. I would say this is a low budget blender that barely gets the job done, i would recommend spending the extra $15-$20 to get a better quality blender.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GQ47Z7BFK4VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,0,,

04/11/2022,United States,2,Marilyn Miller,Okay if all you want is smoothies or baby food.,"My old blender from the 1960s finally up and died. I don't use a blender a lot so I didn't want to spring for a Vitamix or other powerhouse blender. That may have been a mistake.It's okay for pureeing very soft cooked vegetables and soft fruit as long as you put in enough liquid -- at least a cup, more if possible -- but things still get caught under the blades and do not get blended. I think it would overheat easily because it started to smell hot after only 10 seconds on the puree setting. I tried pureeing some rather thin potato soup and ended up with uneven chunks, had to take my immersion blender to it to get the right consistency.It has an easy clean button and that's how I'm accustomed to cleaning a blender, but this had food seeping under the seal that did not get cleaned in the cleaning cycle, so you should plan on taking the whole thing apart after every use.Incidentally, it's loud. It sounds like a jet taking off, even when I put padding under the base.Also, I'm not sure how stable it is. The base is very light plastic and the container is heavy glass. The container does wiggle around on the base, doesn't feel very secure. I'll probably put it out for a garage sale and see if I can find a used Vitamix.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZNUMG1IYFWVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,0,,

It seems to run perfectly, not too noisy, seems plenty powerful enough, definitely MUST have the lid on unlike other taller blenders I've had or else splatter city. Okay, still not quite a deal breaker. But when I have to blend something like frozen cranberries or celery 4-5 times and I still have the CHEW on my smoothie when I'm supposed to be drinking it, THAT is a deal breaker and worthless as a blender.I'll never understand how so many hundreds of people use the same dang blender and not have the same issues. I tried pulsing it after a few blends, held the pulse buttons down for a while. A little better but still had to chew on little parts of celery.

12/19/2021,United States,1,Long-time Customer,Makes Chunky Smoothies,"My previous 10-speed Hamilton Beach blender did a great job, but finally died after 12 years. Nobody actually *needs* 10 speeds on a blender, but the shape of the jar and the blades did a great job at turning my semi-frozen berry/veg/protein concoction into a very smooth-drinking breakfast.This new blender has several problems, however.1. No matter how long I leave it running on high, the smoothie always has many chewy chunks of fruit and veggies. I don't know if it just doesn't re-circulate well enough, or if it gets stuck under the blades.2. The jar is very rectangular compared to the more conical shape of my previous HB blender. The vortex in the previous conical one quickly re-circulated the mixture and produced a fine, consistent puree. This one seems to just whip in more air and creates a lot of foam without actually pulling through the liquid as much.3. The tight-fitting lid is pretty pointless, at least to me. The ability to pour through the lid from its built-in spout is not useful. I'm used to taking off the lid while it's running on high so that I can add protein powder. If the lid is attached firmly, it's very difficult to remove without risking pulling up the entire jar.4. Once the lid is off, the liquid bounces and splashes around way too much all by itself. It splashes out of the jar, even at half capacity. The previous blender would draw the liquid straight down and circulate in a tight vortex.5. The lip of the pour spout is actually constructed with a concave ledge on it, a little divot where the chunks get trapped. I can't tell you how annoying and stupid this is.There are *much* better blenders out there.

11/12/2021,United States,1,Barbara Usack,Awful.,"After reading the reviews I bought this to replace a very cheap Oster that made amazing shakes… Very creamy. Not only does this not blend up my shakes (and I even tried pulverizing the oats and other ingredients before adding them to the blender,) my shakes are very runny on the top with the majority of the ingredients sunk to the bottom.

08/17/2021,United States,5,Jesse Lidgey,I'm stunned...,"We are all familiar with the visual of the crotchety, old man shouting at cars driving 3 mph over the speed limit in his neighborhood. When we see him we may think to ourselves, Geeze guy, settle down, you're going to pull something... before it dawns on us that before long, WE will be that crotchety old man or woman. For me anyway, there is this realization that given how jaded I already am at 35 about all of life's little annoyances that full-on crochetyness is an inevitability...and that it isn't all that far off.What makes me particularly salty are all the CRAP products out there that CRAP OUT on you before they should. When did it become a bleeping foregone conclusion that 80% of consumer products will turn to worthless CRAP in mere months? $200 for this? CRAP in a heartbeat. $120 for that? Yep, turned to CRAP in lightning speed. Sure, the more you spend the lesser the probability the product will be CRAP but there is no hard and fast rule where you spend X and you're guaranteed to avoid CRAP. It's a poor commentary on the whole human race in my opinion...but I digress.Every so often however, in the midst of thousands upon thousands of CRAP products here and CRAP products there, you come across a gem. THIS BLENDER, LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, IS THAT GEM. I think I paid $29 for this thing when I bought it a few months ago. I figured meh...I can either spend $29 and get a CRAP blender or $100 and get CRAP blender like I've historically done in the past...so I decided to go the cheap CRAP option. You can imagine my surprise and utter delight when this beast turned out to NOT be CRAP...but a ray of light and hope in a dark, dark CRAP consumer-product world.I use this blender virtually every night and I'm not easy on it. I jam a lot of frozen fruit down it's gullet before slamming the puree button without remorse and it gobbles the frozen fruit like Joey Chestnut gobbles hotdogs on the Fourth of July. It's incredible. I love this blender. I LOVE IT. And to have paid $29 bucks for this thing?! You kiddin me?!

On the rare occasion I've used it, I use it solely to blend protein powder, almond milk and banana, with 6 small-sized ice cubes from a silicone tray, which I add 2 at a time so as not to jam. Since this purchase is 7 weeks old, Amazon advised me to contact Hamilton Beach (which can only be done via an email submission form), as my purchase is still under warranty; I did. I provided the model number and the issue. I could not initially locate the series number. A CSR from Hamilton Beach write me and guided me to find that before I could be helped. I then made the time to figure that out, send a reply with the series number, and ANOTHER CSR wrote me to tell me that I would need to detail all of the ingredients I've used with the blender, their MEASUREMENTS, and when the last use was, before I could be helped further. I have never had to go through such hoops for a replacement purchase -- of a BLENDER, no less. This thing's going in the trash. Guess I'll eat the darn $35.

07/22/2021,United States,2,LoveSkulls13,After 10 unsuccessful minutes trying to blend a smoothie…,"…I finally gave up, poured the whole, still un blended mass into my food processor and had it done in 20 seconds. Of course, by then it was pudding, not a smoothie. Understand, this was BEFORE I added anything like frozen fruit or other harder to blend items—it was all soft fruits and vegetables. I’ve had excellent luck with refurbished appliances, so I don’t know if it’s the refurbishment that sucks or the appliance itself sucks; all I know is that it…sucks. Maybe it would be okay if you only need it a few times a year for cocktails or something like a thin diet drink, but if you’re plan on using a blender on a regular basis, don’t cheap out like me. The only reason I’m giving this two stars is 1) I should’ve sent it back after the first disappointing time I tried it and 2) when it comes to appliances, more often than not, you get what you pay for—I should’ve paid out for a ninja or some other heavyweight. Because, dude—pudding’s great, but you can’t slurp it down running out the door because you’re always late like me.Update: Forgot to mention another important downside—this thing is LOUD. I mean, like heavy machinery loud. My cats aren’t even fazed by the vacuum cleaner, but when they see me pull this out, they scatter. This makes my food processor sound like gentle rain.

06/27/2021,United States,5,Consumer,NICE BLENDER FOR THE PRICE,"This blender is a nice blender for the price. I use it to make smoothies. It has a glass pitcher, but the top and other parts are plastic. The box indicates that the item is made in China. It is not the quality of product that I am used to owning, but again, for the price it's a nice purchase. The top was too snug and difficult to fit initially, but after a few attempts of firmly pushing it into place and lifting it off, it became easier. Now the top can be put on and taken off easily, while still being the snug fit it needs. I do not put the plastic pieces in the dishwasher because the plastic appears to be of poor quality, but I expect if I hand-wash the plastic it should last as long as the motor. I would recommend this to people who would like a nice blender within this price range. However, if you are looking for top-of-the-line in a blender, this isn't it.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXIMMDB0M5IAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,0,,

06/20/2021,United States,1,S. Bailey,"I Threw This Hot Mess Blender"" in the Trash""","I don't write reviews. However, this blender works so poorly that I'm making an exception.I make fresh juice drinks and smoothies every day. I also travel frequently and I'm happy to use absolutely anything that's available to keep up my routine. I am not a blender snob. I see no point in those $300 blenders and have an amazing $60 blender from Oster for my everyday smoothie workhorse. I purchased this blender to use at a rental house I was at for an extended time during the pandemic. This is the absolute worst blender I've ever encountered. Let me be clear... There is no blending. Chopping? Used loosely, maybe. Blending? No.Blades are dull.Power is weak.Unnecessarily noisy (all blenders are loud. This is NOISY.)Does not blend - anything.Leaves everything in big shredded chunks more like you pulsed a food processor.I first tried a kale drink and it was undrinkable. Everything was the consistency of knife chopped vegetables after blending. And not incorporated into the liquid at all. Ok smoothie drinkers, you know kale can be tough so I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt. I've since tried all of the following: apples, grapes, beets, spinach, orange, celery, cucumber, pineapple, strawberries, kiwi, raspberries. Lots of water, no ice, nothing frozen. All just undrinkable, unmixed, chunky messes every time. I'm happy with thicker drinks with all the pulp. But this...is not that. The tipping point for me - I attempted simple strawberry banana and yogurt smoothies for the kids. 3 of the softest things you can find. Total failure. Never blended up no matter how long it ran. The banana and strawberry stayed in chunks so big they just ate it out of a bowl with a spoon.If you take nothing else from this review know this - this blender is such a hot mess that when I bought another Oster to replace it, I briefly considered keeping it to donate and decided it would be horrible of me to give it anyone else.

06/13/2021,United States,5,Christopher Denny,Read your manual & stop whining like this blender...,"Yes, it might take both thumbs to pop the lid on this blender, but it has to be tight because there is an open and close spout on the top. You could not pour from that spout if the lid was loose. (Better a little tight than loose at all.)...Read the little manual that is provided. It recommends adding 8 ounces of liquid to any beverage that you make: milk, water, juice, vodka--whatever suits your drink. This is not primarily a vegetable chopper. You can't fill it full of carrots and get carrot juice. If you want a smoothie, then follow a smoothie recipe. Add anything hard (like carrots) in chunks; not whole pieces. If you are looking for a great blender for milkshakes and/or smoothies, this is it! Only takes a few minutes to clean. Looks better in person. Nice design. Takes up very little counter space...If you want a healthier shake, then add a protein drink or reduced fat lactose-free milk to frozen yogurt. It's as satisfying as any high-calorie milkshake. I haven't had the occasion yet to add booze, but I'm sure that goes down easy, too. (Plastic flexi-straws are still sold in little boxes at Target for 89 cents.

05/27/2021,United States,4,Novel Gazer,"Good price, good value","Our workhorse Cuisinart blender finally died after 15 years and we needed a replacement. We were willing to spend $80 or so on a Cuisinart or other prestige-name blender, but the reviews were so mixed. Apparently even the big brands just don’t make ‘em like they used to. And all of the plastic (as opposed to glass) now typically used in blender pitchers gave us pause—we just didn’t buy the explanations that plastic is somehow better. We like the solidity of glass. So after reading the mixed reviews on much pricier blenders, we decided to spend less money and take a chance on this blender for the time being. We have been pleasantly surprised. It is light, but feels solid and runs well. And the separate pour spout minimizes drips. The only reasons the review is not five star is that the cleaning setting (an alternative use for one of the regular settings) doesn’t seem to work super well (still need to wash the pitcher out with a sponge, not a huge deal) and the tight-fitting lid is very difficult to pry off when it is time to wash the pitcher.

05/05/2021,United States,1,L. Jimenez,CHEAP PLASTIC,"This is the by far the worst blender I have ever purchased. I previously owned a blender by Hamilton Beach, so I thought it was a decent buy at 29.99. After all, the Hamilton Beach blender I had before which is similar to this model but better quality in every way (rubbery plastic parts rather than hard, crappy easily shattered plastic), also cost me roughly $30. I prefer glass jar blender for the same reason as it comes with a thick, heavy glass, rather than that hard scratchy plastic and which this happens to be, but the glass on this model appears to have a yellowish tint, maybe it's me, but it was the first thing to turn me off. Secondly, the top doesn't close properly and when you look closely at the cheap black plastic there's a thin little odd flap at the top that doesn't adequately cover the useless hole in the lid and the plastic appears to be made of some hard black play-doh my two-year old chewed up and fashioned into the blender top, complete with a tiny, clear plastic flip top that scream I'm cheap! Not smooth at all! C'mon Hamilton Beach! I know it's all about planned obsolescence with products we buy these days, but this is downright INSULTING to make something of such poor craftsmanship.

The gasket to keep it tight, failed by the 4th use. Thought it was used error. No, it wasn't. That is why it made it harder to clean when it didn't seal right. Honestly, I'd pass this one over. Don't go through the trouble I did. It now doesn't turn on, even after the reset they advise you to do. It has turned into more of a headache to use this blender than the small single blender from Slobly, I found. It was a good price but it not worth it.

Not sure if they got a lemon or defective blender because it blended up these Frozen pieces of banana in seconds. I had a blendtec that was probably $350 that I had for many years that ended up failing. Of course this Hamilton Beach is not nearly as powerful or as loud but I could buy 12 Hamilton Beach blenders for the price of just one blendtec.

I was sent another one and this one turned on but the blending power is really poor. The blades don't spin contents into them unless it is super liquidy and so it will only blend what is immediately around it but none of the other contents so you have to constantly stir.

You will rise above and you will walk just a little higher than those around you...but only as a beacon of patience and hope to the untested.

03/25/2021,United States,3,Rick,Cheap and does the job but has quality issues.,"The Hamilton Beach Power Elite Blender is an affordable but very basic blender.Materials and build quality - I give it an average rating because, while it does the job of blending, the build quality and materials is not good and is only adequate to doing the job. The glass jar has a yellowish tint to it like the glass has impurities in it. The plastics are hard and thin. The lid is very difficult to remove and I always have to make sure I have a good hold on the jar before trying to remove the lid. The buttons have a hard clicky feel. The rubber feet are perhaps the most annoying aspect of the build quality. The rubber feet on my unit leaves black marks on my quartz countertop that are difficult to wipe off without some kind of cleaning chemical (dish soap won't remove the marks). When the motor runs, the base unit (underneath) gives off a foul dried fish smell, and no I have never put fish in the blender. I can only guess the smell is coming from the plastics or motor heating up. If you have any concerns about carcinogens in plastics, I would recommend to avoid this blender. The rubber feet marks and the difficult to remove lid are the main reasons, this blender isn't getting 5 stars.The good - I purchased this blender to make smoothies, and for that it works well. No complaints there.Yes, it does need adequate liquids to blend and move the solids.Overall this is an ok blender when on sale, but I would recommend to spend a bit more to get a better quality blender. If price is absolute then this blender would suffice for basic functions. This unit is definitely one of those you get what you pay for.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GBJHNRBHQZ4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,3,,

03/21/2021,United States,2,LauraBabora,Eh...,"I mean, you get what you pay for, right?I don't like that the glass container & the bottom console don't click or snap in together. The glass container just... sits there. So if you pick up the console & glass container together, if you move the wrong way, the glass container will fall over & break.Also, I've found that the blades don't work half the time, as if the gear part underneath doesn't connect properly with the gear part on the console, so there is no action happening, so I have to move the container or wiggle it around. I've made sure nothing is broken or interfering with the gears but it still just doesn't work sometimes.The lid goes over the lip of the glass container on the top & you have to really force it on & off... which to me, is a hassle & kind of annoying. I've had some better blenders where the lid sits inside of the lip of the glass container & it's secure & doesn't let anything leak, so this one isn't my favorite.In regards to blending power, it's easy if you use liquids or easily squished things, like small chunks of tomatoes or onions. But as soon as I use ice or frozen fruit or anything else with a little bit of substance, like peanut butter, it doesn't work. The blades just get stuck. I try to pulse it so it breaks free, but that doesn't do anything either.So this is good if you need something for simple things like maybe making salsa, but if you want frozen margaritas or smoothies using frozen fruit or even peanut butter, good luck getting anywhere.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23TWWFME32Z5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,0,,

This has some problems. 1. Sometimes the ingredients are slammed up against the bottom of the lid. The blade design throws things upward.Unfortunately the lid is too tight to fit onto the glass body so I have to use one hand to keep it from coming off. It's also a good idea to make sure the top two hatches are tightly closed. I dare not open the top hatch to add ingredients because cleaning the walls later is not fun. 2. The ingredients can get air locked about the time the consistency of the smoothie is perfect. Because there is no vortex it can trap a large air bubble against the blade which stops all mixing and the blade spins out of control until you stir. That's not a big deal but the vortex would have prevented this. 3. The large diameter at the top of the glass makes it difficult to pour into a regular size glass. It can be done by scraping the smoothie out with a spatula instead of pouring. This is why Osterizer used a four cornered vessel I guess - one of the corners created a pour spout. 4. Not fun to clean the lid. Too many hard to reach areas. Will probably need to find a dedicated brush that will fit it.I would have bought another Osterizer but their reliability ratings seemed much lower. They had the tapered vessel, the vortex and the easy to clean lid perfected in the old unit I had.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HEZ5T5ABB3LR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,2,,

The final time, just now, I again tried to make a banana milkshake although my hand mixing didn’t seem to be working like before.

It shouldn’t be amazing to anyone that a blender can handle a task as simple as blending a protein shake and fruit but it does it and it does it so well. Frozen fruits, fresh fruits, this blender doesn’t care. It will blend it like it’s the protein power.

01/01/2021,United States,1,n0nch,"Please pass on this, it’s not worth it.","I wanted a blender so I could make a few smoothies, and potentially sauces. I read the reviews and saw that they were primarily negative, but a few good ones thrown in too. I decided to take a chance since I didn’t mind if it crapped out after a year, I just wanted something that could easily blend and work for a bit.I was so wrong in taking the chance and now have to deal with the annoyance of returning it. I tried out a simple 3 ingredient banana smoothie; oats, banana, and milk.The first step is to blend the oats, and it took me about 2-3 minutes of pulsing, blending, and taking the jar off to shake it around to get them somewhat blended.

10/19/2020,United States,1,Amazon Customer,A blender that can’t blend,"I mainly bought a blender for two things: smoothies and salsa. This blender can barely blend either. The day I first got it I tried making a tomatillonsalsa and it would just refuse to properly purée the salsa and instead just stirred everything inside for a while (no matter which option I picked). I gave up on the salsa. A few days later I tried making a banana milkshake and it took so long to blend one banana. I had to continuously stir it with a spoon in between pulses bc otherwise it just won’t blend and still it was chunky. Tonight was the last straw when I was making a salsa for my burrito and after a feeble attempt and blending my tomatoes, onions peppers and cilantro into a salsa it just died out on me and refuses to turn in.Overall, if you want a blender that actually blends, DO NOT GET THIS BLENDER",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YS8FRMB3BR1J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,1,,

09/18/2020,United States,4,danielle,Great Value for the Money,"Overall this blender has worked well for us. It gets used 5+ times a week for making smoothies with frozen fruit, fresh spinach, peanut butter, protein powder, and almond milk. I have to do the salsa quick blend option a few times before I can hit the smoothie option. Sometimes when I hit the smoothie option to start the frozen fruit will get stuck above the blade and the blade just goes and goes, not blending anything. Its a little annoying but we have learned to use it so that doesn't happen.I have tried to use it for food processing - making salsa, pesto, energy bars. But this product is definitely NOT designed for that kind of food processing.Cleanup is easy and I like that the blade comes off completely so you can really clean it. The glass is thick and quite sturdy, I have never worried about breaking it.So, if you're looking for a blender to make some delicious smoothies or milkshakes, this one will do.

I contacted Hamilton Beach and after some back and forth I was able to get a replacement part within in warranty period, so no cost, but it did take a few weeks.

I taped it back together and I'm shopping for a better blender.We use it EVERYDAY for our coffee so it's important that it work and not just break. It's just my husband and I using it in the morning. 2 adults, using it a total of about a minute a day total. Especially this time around we have been VERY gentle with it, knowing of the previous issue (lasted about a year this time vs. 3-4 moths the first time arounf)... We also usually just rinse it out, since we only use it for coffee, so wear and tear wise I don't think the base should be cracking after a couple months use.

   First, I’ll start by saying I’ve ordered this blender 3x. I first ordered it in 2018. At the time I used it maybe two days a week before I lost in in a house fire. While replacing everything, I ordered this again Feb 2020. The first one arrived broken. Amazon sent a replacement. I used it faithfully at least 5 days a week to make my morning smoothie. I always add leafy greens to my smoothies along with flax seeds and chia seeds. They didn’t blend well and my smoothies were always crunchy with seeds and bits of greens; kale was the worse. It also has a hard time with ice and frozen fruits/veggies. It took a delicate balance of almond milk and water to get it to finally blend without making the smoothie too watery. Washing it wasn’t too bad but the gap below the component holding the blades was nearly impossible to clean.I noticed the motor starting to have a hard time about 4 months in so I started to break out my smoothie by adding a few ingredients at a time and then blending. It officially went out for good just under 6 months in. Since the price is low, I’d say double it and get something that lasts longer. My main motive for buying this one is because of the glass, but now I’ll be looking for more well known blenders.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TG3CUKFYXNXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,7,,

06/04/2020,United States,1,Karen,"Never again, Hamilton Beach!","This is a terrible blender.I received it as a gift a few years ago when I was contemplating getting more into cooking (I don’t really cook) and a friend heard me talk about researching blenders. It’s horrible. It’s never been particularly good at blending and the tiny food processing part is also not great. However, it was a gift and I was basically stuck with it. I also did not start magically cooking (surprise, surprise) so that was fine.Until yesterday.Now, due to the pandemic I’ve been home ALL THE TIME, and I have actually finally been trying to make more food. Last year, I made some watermelon juice with the blender by blending up chunks of watermelon and I thought, hey, let’s do that again when I bought a bad watermelon back in March, April? (Time has ceased to have meaning.) This watermelon was one of the ones that is pretty dense and not sweet at all but should taste OK with some ice mixed in as a drink. So I cut it into chunks, tossed it into the blender, hit the button, and waited.And waited. And waited. And waited.Nothing blended.I tried stirring it a little. Taking out some of the watermelon. Adding some water. Nada.In desperation I kept hitting the pulse button and that didn’t do anything either.Please keep in mind that this blender sounds like an aircraft carrier taking off directly next to your head. I put ear plugs in.I let the blender on for 15 minutes before giving up. That was definitely a mistake on my part - I should have given up much earlier.But the story’s not over!So yesterday, I once again cut open a watermelon to find out it was terrible (I just can’t pick them, I guess), so I decided to try the blender again. Only this time, I thought I’d be smart and dice the watermelon into tiny little pieces first. (Think the size of onions in your salsa.) And, hurray, it worked! Juice was made in about 5 seconds!Feeling pleased with myself, I pick up the pitcher to pour it out and IT SEPARATES COMPLETELY FROM THE BASE. The watermelon juice explodes out everywhere over my clothes, the counter, my cabinets, and my wood floor.So now I no longer have a usable blender, wasted about an hour of my day (prepping and cleaning), and had to toss out half a watermelon (and most likely the other half).I’ve used this blender less than 10 times.DO NOT BUY THIS BLENDER.

I then flipped the base over and a lot of smoke started coming out of the vents. It smoked over 5 minutes. Thankfully I was able to return it.

12/21/2019,United States,5,Bryan A. Welser,Beats my $200 Breville hands down,"I probably should have reviewed this product sooner, but I'm generally just not a review-writing kind of guy. But it was about 6-ish years ago when I really got into making frozen fruit smoothies for breakfast. I thought I needed a super special, extra powerful blender, so I considered the Vitamix, but decided it was too much money to spend at the time. I instead found a very highly reviewed Breville that was about $200. It was amazing - for exactly two weeks. Then it just died. Being so new, I just exchanged it through Amazon, and the new one lasted about 10 months before breaking down. This time I called Breville, and thankfully, it was still under warranty, so they sent me another one. The third one lasted about a year - better, but I still felt like I shouldn't have gone through three fairly expensive blenders in less than two years. I considered the Vitamix again, but in the end, decided to go cheap and see what happened - at under $30, if I went through a blended a year, after 10 years I still would come out ahead compared to the Vitamix (and if it ended up being terrible, I could always get the Vitamix later).Enter this Hamilton Beach blender. It was very well reviewed at the price point I was looking at, so I figured I would give it a shot. Close to 5 years later, and it's still going strong. In fact, I would say it hasn't lost a beat since it was brand new. Admittedly, I'm not making smoothies every day anymore, but I did for several years - and I do still make a few per week. It's always there when I need it. So glad I went with this model and not another expensive one! When (if!) it does end up breaking down, I will not hesitate before buying the exact same model again. Thanks for an outstanding product, Hamilton Beach.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32BHY8SEII0W9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,7,,

I haven't tried doing any crushed ice drinks so am not sure how it would handle that task. The pulse features work quite well for quick blasting while adding ingredients. The blade assembly unscrews from the pitcher for cleaning, as most blenders do, so it is easy to clean. I run the glass pitcher through the dishwasher.

So, I called Hamilton Beach and explained my problem.First, the glass jar isn't a warrantied item (no surprise). Second, they no longer manufacture the glass jar, so you can't buy a new one, and third the way they offer to make it right is to offer to sell you a whole new unit at half price.Unfortunately, half of an inflated price, plus $10 shipping, leaves you only a few pennies shy of what it would cost to buy another one on Amazon with free shipping.

It chops ice and frozen strawberries easily, I can do either the milk shake setting the whole time or pulse the ice chop setting. Literally done in less than a minute total.

05/16/2019,United States,4,Anon,"Great basic blender, nice price.","We needed a simple unit for occasional blending tasks. We wanted something with a glass jar and a reputable brand but don't need to liquify baseball bats, brew soup, or other nonsense. Just an occasional puree, smoothie, etc. Other HB products we've purchased in the past have performed well so we went with this. The base is a bit light, but it is stable and works nicely. The jar is sturdy and the contours really do help make turbulence when blending to assist in a thorough mix. The jar base is easy to attach to the base, and is easy to remove to clean.

If you're thinking about buying one, though, you should know that the collar (the plastic ring that screws onto the bottom of the jar), will probably not last you. It was probably a couple weeks after I got the blender, when I screwed it on a little too tight, and that caused it to crack. Luckily, I figured out a way to make it work in spite of that. I was able to use it every day, for more than a year, just by being really careful with it. Finally, the collar has another crack, and I simply can't use it without my beverage seeping through the bottom as soon as I remove it from the base.If I could buy a replacement collar for it, I wouldn't mind at all.

02/17/2019,United States,2,AD32,Waste of space,"I received this blender as a Christmas gift the year before last and it's done nothing but frustrate me. First of all, my mother has a Hamilton Beach blender she got as a wedding gift in 1984 and that's what I was using before my brother gave me this. I tried it out by making a smoothie that I usually made in my mom's old blender and the new blender's smoothie was waaaaay more chunky than the old one's ever was. Nothing I made is like it should be. I can't make any blender baking recipes because it won't hold up to solid ingredients. Ice is hit or miss. The last straw was tonight I wanted to try blending dates with pumpkin puree and the thing wouldn't even turn even after I added a half cup of almond milk. I had to take the lid off and kind of stir it while it was on to get it going. Super dangerous. And I have to apologize to my neighbors because the thing is sooooooo loud! I'm so done with this thing. I can't think of a reason to keep it. I've used the mini chopper bowl that comes with it once and needless to say, that was also a let down. I wanted to grate baby carrots and just ended up with chunks of varying sizes. Oh! And I am constantly angered trying to get whatever I have in the blender out of it seeing as the sides aren't smooth. You have to try to get your spatula around the wavy sides of the pitcher and ultimately end up washing much of your food down the drain. The hole in the top, which is presumably for adding things while the blender is in use, is more of just a way for the stuff inside to shoot onto your counter and walls since you can't fully close it. The old Hamilton Beach had a removable magnifying class insert that allowed you to add ice/ingredients, but then close it back up completely and look through it to see how things were mixing. Such a step down with this one.Currently searching Amazon for a replacement. It's sad that the Hamilton Beach blender from 30 years ago is so much better than what they currently offer.",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34CIEY9E2KUMR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,0,,

11/18/2018,United States,1,Sir Deiblerr,Zero stars,"You’re better off hand chopping whatever you’re making. No idea how this got 4 stars, paid reviews? In order to make a smoothie you’ll need half a gallon of liquid per 1/2 cup of solids. It simply does not blend otherwise. Even with that you’ll end up with chunks and berry skins. There is no user error here, read all manuals and instructions...this is just a terrible excuse for a blender. Forget about making something like pesto, unless you want to use a gallon of oil per basil leaf, nothing will blend. To top it off this thing sounds like bone crushing death. It is literally louder than a garbage truck. Further, the base is wobbly and the cheap plastic lid is constantly stuck.

10/02/2018,United States,1,P W George,Nice blender with a serious flaw,"I bought this blender two years ago, mainly to make smoothies and occasional milkshakes. It was used, on average, once a day for less than five minutes. It was excellent for what I wanted and had a design which greatly helped the blending process without need for constant stopping to get unmixed material down to the blades. After about a year it started leaking and I discovered that the plastic 'nut' that attaches the blades to the glass jar had cracked. I tried to repair it with different adhesives but nothing worked. Thinking I had just been unlucky with the first one I purchased a second of the same model. It worked just as well as the first one until the same problem occurred. Now I was a little upset and so I submitted warranty claims for both to HB. They accepted the claims and agreed to send replacement parts but with a charge of $6 for S/H for each. I replied asking them if they would guarantee the replacement parts without charging for anything if they failed (since I suspected a manufacturing problem in general with that part) and have heard nothing back, which I take as a 'no'. Too bad--I'm now using an Oster which is supposed to be pretty bulletproof.

09/21/2018,United States,1,Nice guy,Doesn't do what it is built to...,"It was a total waste of money, as this blender, though extremely heavy, doesn't blend!!The motor seems really powerful, yet the belender's performance is really below average. Hamilton Beach is a known name in kitchen gadgets, but this one is a huge disappointment. I have tried blending smoothies, ginger, and something as tender as mint and cilantro...the machine just won't do it. You have to keep running it, and time and again shake the jug, and poke with a wooden spoon, keep adding water...it gets extremely frustrating. It comes with a smaller blender, which is equally useless. Being brand new, it couldn't be blunt blades..it's just the way it has been built. I bought this mainly for a glass jug, as it's easier to clean and the smell of food doesn't permeate...but I am super mad at myself for not reading the previous reviews. I would go for a plastic blender that would actually work!!!My sincere advice is, don't buy this! Save yourself the frustration in the kitchen. There are blenders that are less costly, and do a better job!If the product still had return time on it, I won't take a second to send it back.

01/23/2018,United States,4,Carol Joy,Works great but hard to wash & dry pieces.,"POSITIVES: attractive, sturdy, well-made, does the job but protein powders ‘almost’ blend easily with some scraping-off the sides required. Good pouring spot in the corner of the square-ish shaped carafe. Priced appropriately.NEGATIVES: intricately designed lid with plenty of seams and small spaces is hard to wash quickly and powders get stuck in the very small grooves and pour spout. The lid is also hard to remove but probably because it offers a very secure closure: no worries it’ll fall off with pouring. But it is a struggle to pull off.The underside of the bottom piece, (which holds the blade), is scalloped and VERY annoying to dry thoroughly. These two factors I really hate.It’s also LOUD! All reviews for the option of buying it with the sound shield (more money and takes more space) were not great and to me didn’t block too much noice on the videos posted with sound comparison. This doesn’t bother me as much as cleaning the nooks and seams of the bottom and the lid. But I suppose if you use it daily (it’s as loud as a weed whacker, but with a whining noise), is likely not good for your hearing.NEUTRAL: the Glass carafe is HEAVY! I don’t mind as I’m strong but it was a surprise compared to my 15 year old model that bit the dust. However when my arthritis bothers my fingers, its weight is more challenging. BUT the weight is indicative of its quality.I considered returning it but the quality is so good I feel it will last a very long time. If you don’t mind noise and spending a little extra time to have to immerse wash and do detailed drying, I recommend it!",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27Z1HCL8U3FNV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,8,,

11/14/2017,United States,5,Mark Massingill,Does what I bought it for well.,"I bought this blender specifically for making breakfast smoothies. So far it has done it's job quite well and I am happy with my purchase. I normally use 2 bananas, a cup or so of blueberries and a scoop of protein powder along with a cup or so of water and this blender gives me a really well blended smoothie. Sometimes I use strawberries and pineapple instead of the blueberries or some papaya or cantaloupe, so far the machine has had no problem with anything I've thrown at it. Sometimes I use frozen fruit and it seems to make no difference to the blender but normally I use fresh fruit, I don't like frozen smoothies so I don't add ice or use much frozen fruit if I have a choice. That's all I can rate it on since I only use it for smoothies.

10/07/2017,United States,5,Zigurd Mednieks,"All the right features, no frippery, but not a premium feel",and it held up to quarantine use!,"My original review:This is a very good blender at a rock-bottom price. This is what you want: A 700W motor. A glass bowl. The bowl has the same wave shape as the slightly more expensive model. The gasket is integrated with the blade assembly, so taking the bowl apart for cleaning is one part simpler than on most blenders. No gimmicky accessories.It loses one star because the lid is weirdly and not too usefully complicated, and lightweight. The economies have to come from somewhere: Where higher-priced blenders have a chunky solid base that holds the blade assembly onto the bottom of the bowl, this blender has a lightweight base. It seems solid enough. The fake brushed stainless steel front panel fools nobody. This isn't a $200 blender for $30. But after the second daiquiri you'll be thinking The price difference buys a lot of daiquiris.Addendum:Upgraded to five stars. All the suspect cheap parts, like the base and lid, have held up very well. During quarantine I have been drinking a lot of smoothies as meal replacements. The blender gets use almost every day, often twice a day. No worries. The complex lid with the pouring spout works really well.Altogether much mech better than the price would lead one to expect.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TJQPBKUSXCJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,4,

I've been making the same type of smoothie my whole life at my parents house with no issue. Once I tried making the same exact smoothie is this blender, nothing would blend together. I had to constantly shut it off, un plug it for safety reasons and put my spoon in the blender to mix and move it around.

09/07/2017,United States,1,Scitch,Don't waste your money on this blender,"Absolute piece of junk. I ordered this blender on Amazon in May, 2016. It's now Sept., 2017 and the blender leaks so badly that it's unusable. And I'm not talking about it leaking a tablespoon or two while you're blending a smoothie. I measured how fast it leaked for this review. It leaked out 2.5 cups of water in under 45 seconds. I can't tell where the leak is coming from but no amount of re-seating the washer/blade assembly or reattaching the plastic base even slows down the leak.

03/27/2017,United States,3,OregonBorne,You Get What You Pay For,"The old adage, that you get what you pay for is pretty well confirmed with this blender. It works, but that's about the best I can say for it. I also like the sturdy glass body.The low price was the primary reason I bought it. But I'm a hard-core green-smoothie guy, and I use my blender several times per week. So after trying this one out for a few months, I think I'm ready to buy something a little better.To begin with, it doesn't blend very well. I'm not sure if there is a design problem, or if the blades are just sort of dull. But I have to let it run for a couple minutes to get my spinach and kale blended to a smooth consistency. It's also loud. Like, louder than an ordinary blender. And when you have to let it run extra long to get things blended, that's doubly unpleasant.The lid is awful. It is extremely difficult to put on and take off. I'm a 45 yr old man with hard-working strong hands, and I have trouble every time I try to remove the lid. I have to press so hard with my thumbs that it hurts a little bit. And they added a couple of openings in the lid that are probably intended for some useful purpose, but they just allow slight leakage.The motor is strong, and works well. Only 2 speeds, but really, that's all I would ever need.I'd say if you're looking for an inexpensive blender for occasional use (margaritas and milkshakes), and you don't mind wrestling with a stubborn lid, then this blender is probably just fine for you.

02/01/2017,United States,4,DavidH,Does what I need it to do at the right price,"I have the red version of this model 58147 and it was purchased approximately 4 years ago. It hasn't been used for that entire time as I startedusing a NutriBullet. But my second Nutribullet recently bit the dust and being money challenged I decided to dig this one out and try it. I've been starting to make some simple drinks such as baby greens, frozen fruit along with almond and coconut milk. I watched some YouTube videos by people who do high powered blending but testing out inexpensive blenders to see if they could make their normal drinks. What I learned is that it takes several steps (blend greens, harder fruits) along with your liquid first and then add other ingredients (perhaps in batches depending on how much fruit you are using) to acheive results similar to a higher powered blender. When I follow those guidelines I'm actually pretty shocked at how smooth the drinks turn out. I believe they come out better than in the NutriBullet (600W).. I was hesitant to start using this again due to the larger size and having to go through more to clean it but it hasn't been that bad using the EasyClean setting. I know people like to complain about blender noise and I usually can't relate much to that (what do you expect, really.....) but I have noticed that running this blender for several minutes starts to bother my ears and make me feel like I am about to get a headache. I have a Montel Healthmaster blender (don't want to use that to make little smoothies) so I know what loud is. There seems to be something about the pitch of the sound that gets to me. I made homemade almond milk in it today and it comes out better than in the Ninja blender pitcher that I got for Christmas (that I just haven't been able to use to get the drinks smooth enough-maybe with more experimenting who knows but I am not into gravel-ly drinks). Consumer Reports rated this blender pretty low but it seems to work well for me. For the price it's hard to beat. The only thing that could be better is the Oster blender in this price range if you can get one with a glass pitcher.",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXQUUA2N2SHWV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,0,,

So, expect to get what you're paying for. It's basic and somewhat easy to clean. The bottom has a gap, so it's easy around the base, for your food to get stuck. Each time I use it, I have to take it apart and clean it all out, then let it all dry and put it back together. Our more expensive blender was a sold connection, so once you cleaned, you dried and put back, without having to take everything apart each time, so they obviously didn't cleverly design this model! Another thing is the top cover is plastic and it fights extremely tightly. It might not be too easy for some people to secure it in place (something to consider). Also, suggestion: Hold it well, when you open the top, as previously mentioned, lid fits on so tight, it causes suction when you're blending. I thought I would like the top lip for liquids but I find it easier to pour through the glass jar spout instead. I think that for the price we paid, it was worth it because if it was $25 or more, I would recommend something else.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14IVN5DXLF7CT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,9,,

12/17/2016,United States,5,G. Kilbride,Difference a day makes,"I've been using a highly rated Oster blender but shaped like a tornado. Ridiculous design. I kept changing to specialized blades before realizing it didn't matter at all. The power and quality and 14 speeds are wasted when there's simply not enough room at the base. I had to stop repeatedly and stir things around.My priority in a new purchase was a value blender with a wide base and designed to keep things moving. There's nothing more annoying in blender use than a loud motor trying to spin but nothing going on other than burning smell while wearing out the motor. That describes Oster. But I had a recent timeshare week in Virginia. The unit had a Hamilton Beach blender very similar to this one. It worked great with my typical breakfast shake. Unfortunately I forgot to write down the model number. But the look and features were the same. I took a shot on this Power Elite model, after careful study of reviews here and elsewhere. Hamilton Beach touts the so-called wave action, or whatever, in many of its designs. Mostly I think that's a crock, that the wide base enables traffic to keep moving. It's like more lanes on a freeway.Regardless, after one usage I'm incredibly pleased. I didn't baby this at all. Instead of incremental input like with Oster I decided to dump everything in at once. It is a protein shake with roughly 9 ounces of liquid plus plenty of ice and also a bag of frozen fruit and green veggies. The blob of frozen spinach is what troubled Oster most.Not this guy. I pushed the first button, one that said Milk Shake among other things, and the Hamilton Beach plowed smack through it. There were a few brief hesitations but I was never concerned I'd have to stop and stir. The variance between Friday with Oster and Saturday with Hamilton Beach was incredible. With Oster I was forever changing modes, along with Low or High, desperate to find anything that threatened to work.Pouring was surprisingly simple and effective. From the looks of things I thought gobs would remain in the jar. Nope.There are a few issues: This is a low priced model so many of the parts other than the jar are plastic, in contrast to my Oster and other blenders I've used. Instead of a manual there's more like a brief pamphlet. The lid is relatively difficult to snap on and also to remove. You have to identify the proper place to put your thumb to use. Also, the ability to store the cord in the bottom of the base is wildly overstated. In multiple tries couldn't get it to travel more than a half foot before stop and refusal.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YC04WJ52X61P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,13,,

Ice cubes will get cut down to just under 3/4 and then rattle around on the bottom.It's like there's a dead zone below and next to the blades and the twirl created by the blades isn't strong or directed enough to lift stuff out of that zone. I think a V-shaped container would work better. I looked and saw many other blenders have that shape - and for a reason!I do like the spout on this model, it allows or the liquid to be portioned out very precisely and without mess. The little door on top of the lid that you can open to add things while the blender is working, is too small and looks like it will be the first thing to break, it's just attached by a thin piece of plastic.

With this blender it takes me almost 10 minutes for this very simple thing, because ice and or banana chunks just never get sucked into the blades. I'll have to stop and push stuff down half a dozen times until I accept defeat and drink it with the ice and banana chunks. (And yes, there is plenty of liquid).Also it's so loud and I live in an apartment so I feel like I can't use it late at night or in the morning without irritating my neighbors.My old $20 grocery store personal water bottle blender (Oster brand if you're looking) lasted 4 years before the plastic cracked, was much quieter, and did a great job blending the same ingredients.

While I can't say that this blender has the same power, it will actually blend my smoothies. more easily than the Blend-Tec. The Blend-Tec will blend and pulverize something like kale, whereas this won't (there will be tiny bits of green), but this will blend with less liquid and less trouble (less having to stop and add more liquid, less having to stop and help it along with a spatula).I think this is a great blender for the price, especially since it has a glass jar, so if you need to blend soups or something else warm, this works well for that.

08/20/2016,United States,5,GeeMan,Loved It So Much I Bought a Second One!,"I'm so impressed with this blender (including its price) that I just purchased a second one so I'll always have a clean pitcher and related hardware (I live alone and it can take a few days to fill the dishwasher up enough to justify running it). First of all, at 700 Watts, this thing packs a lot more horsepower than most low-priced blenders (many of which seem to fall in the 400-500 Watt range). I use it for fruit/milk/protein powder smoothies and this thing has no problem fully blending things thoroughly (including pulverizing ice cubes pretty much completely). I also love the fact that the pitcher is made entirely of glass and the handle is an integral part of the glass (not a strapped-on attachment which can/did break on my previous blender). And the screw-on base/blade assembly is very easy to detach by hand for cleaning (unlike with my previous blender, which was unbelievably difficult to disassemble).",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R199205WT5003Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,2,,

06/26/2016,United States,1,Ramsey Campbell,Unacceptable and Dangerous,"Unbelievable, after only two uses the bottom simply fell apart. The mess was spectacular as I was making a blueberry smoothie at the time. According to the appliance's manual, the cutting blades are permanently affixed to the bottom of the glass pitcher. Not in my case. The bottom simply fell out as I lifted the pitcher to pour. And there is no way to reattach it even if you wanted to. Apparently the cutting blades are supposed to be glued on to a gasket at the bottom of the pitcher. And somebody forgot to or didn't use enough glue. This is not only unacceptable, it is dangerous. It may be that that mine was that rare one in a million failure and other Hamilton Beach blenders are perfectly fine. But the question before you buy this is; Do you feel lucky?",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22EYZ14R3WPM9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,4,,

This blender works well when it comes to heavy duty ice crushing, although, I have to use pulse mode for this or I start to smell the motor getting hot. The problem I have is that after 1 year of relatively light use, the printing on the stainless steel name plate, around the buttons, easily smears. The base unit has never been submersed in water and has been lightly wiped clean with a damp cloth. When I was using the unit yesterday I happen to touch the metal plate and the printing easily smeared and is now illegible. I'll keep the current rating as long as the motor holds up but the manufacturer needs to re-evaluate their production process when it comes to printing the face-plate.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WR9VFD0D0HAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,1,,

So I use: 16oz H2o, 2-3 good hanfuls of greens, spinach or kale, mustard, dandilion or whatever else my CSA gives my each week, then I add 2-3 cups of frozen fruit plus a banana if desired, 2 Tbs prouted Flax and then stevia for sweetness if desired. The pour spout is nice and easy to use, the entire blender is super easy to clean. I am using recipes from JJ Smith's 30 day Green Smoothie lifestyle books and that's why I bought this blender.

12/02/2015,United States,5,Adrien C,Finally found an affordable multifunction blender ! Love it !,"I was looking for a blender to make some simple cocktail and milkshake, but i actually did not have much money to spend on it. After a few research i ended up on this item and i am so happy not to have spent more than 30 dollar on a blende, since this one did perfect cocktails (i used it a few times a week maximum)To my point of view, this blender is a great option for people looking for a smoothie maker that will not cost hundreds of dollars. When used properly, that means adding liquid to every recipe you put inside, it will be able to blend ice, fruit and vegetables though it will struggle a little bit if you put lots of leafy greens.This item should be able to make you frozen blended shakes or puree vegetables without any problem.However, don’t be dumb, this is what i would call « an amateur blender » ; it won’t be able to make nut butter, mix dough or grate coffee beans even though it has those options because the motor doesn’t have enough torque and will burn out if you try.The key thing to appreciate this product is not expecting a professional level quality from it or performance. If you’re not particular with the consistency of your smoothies but just want something affordable capable of basic blending functions then this machine is a very good choice.It was a good choice for me as it matches perfectly with what i expected from it.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NDs3A+rzL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810lpxxyyIL._SY1600.jpg",,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KFNCBPD114RO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,68,,

The lid has this little heat vent flap which is great for letting out steam when blending hot foods, and it doesn't cause anything to splash out.My problem with this blender is that the lid is INCREDIBLY difficult to get on and off. Once you push it on, good luck prying that thing off, especially when handling hot liquids. It actually doesn't bother me too much, because I just hold the lid on without actually pushing it on all the way.

Thought this cheaper blender would be equivalent since the power is the same. Maybe the motor is strong but it doesn't grind up raw cashews for my morning shake. The B&D one made a wonderful smooth shake with frozen kale, raw cashews, protein power, etc. The photo is after 5 minutes of blending -- way more blending than I had to do with my B&D model.

10/16/2015,United States,1,jim,"Lacks safety feature, blends OK-subpar, loud","Edit: 12/8/150 stars!! Worst blender I've ever owned/seen! Didn't know I was a blender critic until I had such a bad one. At it's best it is mediocre and at it's worst it is awful. Spend an extra $10 or do some better research than I did before purchase.My biggest qualm with this blender is a safety issue, other than that it functions as an average blender, that operates loudly.The base spins whether or not you have the blender or the chopper attached to it. The buttons do not require you to press them completely down and into place before the unit turns on, and due to this, I have accidentally turned on the blender multiple times. Thankfully none have resulted in injury, but you can see how this is problematic.Aside from directly injuring yourself from the base, for me personally, the times I've accidentally turned it on it has startled me and the person next to me enough to drop a plate... if you have limited counter space, I can almost guarantee you that some point you will do the same thing... because inevitably something gets pushed into the sensitive buttons of the unit and turns it on. One workaround is to leave the unit unplugged obviously, but when you're multitasking, it tends not the be your first thought...In terms of how it operates as a blender, it's just OK, bordering on subpar. But for less than $30 what do you expect? I suppose...It does a poor job of chopping ice in a smoothie type drink, and requires you to leave it on for upwards of a minute if you're making something icy... and in the case of slushy mojitos, you're gonna want it on for a over a minute to get the right consistency.. it's very loud. It's significantly louder than any of the three vacuums I own (FYI one is a shop vac). Hence why the pairing of sensitive buttons with it's loud operation is especially troublesome... that and the fact that it takes much longer to blend than other traditional blenders or bullet type blenders...In terms of the chopping function, its OK... my stand-alone chopper works better, and has additional blades.... I find that this one gets whatever you're chopping clumped in areas and then just spins its wheels, not doing much... there's a fair amount of opening, mixing, and re-chopping to get anything done...My grade: C-",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1M4U11AHRMBT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPI0,0,,

Here's what it is capable of blending:Milk with powder;Milk with yogurt;The former two with fruit IF you layer it properly and constantly move the fruit around.That's it. The final straw came today when I tried roasted red peppers and it couldn't handle those. If you just want to make some very basic smoothies it's okay (although excessively noisy).

09/25/2015,United States,5,Veggielove,I love the crystal clear thick glass pitcher; it made with quality!,"This is a powerful (motor) blender for the price! I love the crystal clear thick glass pitcher; it made with quality! It has convenient measurements embossed on the glass. Parts, blade, etc. removes for sterilization. I wash it immediately after use, so I haven't had to put it in the dishwasher, but I believe the glass and blade will do fine in the dishwasher. I recommend to wash the cover and plastic base part by hand. The plastic lid/cover is made not as strong as the motor base or the glass pitcher, this is why I would recommend washing this part in sudsy hot water. If you need a blender that blends to a super fine- smooth baby food puree texture- this blender will not blend to that fine of a consistency. The cover could be improved, but for the price it's really a quality product! It's a wonderful blender and it also blends ice into smoothies! It doesn't take up a lot of room. It's attractive and I can easily leave it on my kitchen counter.

My favorite setting is the milkshake, it blends it nice and smooth and you get a really nice texture to the shake.
