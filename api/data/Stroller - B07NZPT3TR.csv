05/05/2023,United States,2,Mo,"Lightweight, Feels Cheap, won’t last on city streets","Cheap materials. It’s lightweight but takes way more effort to push/stroll than other strollers. It also takes a bit of effort to open and collapse. There is NO way this thing will last on most city streets. This rolls similar to our $20 umbrella stroller. Strolling this in a mall, store, or a nicely paved sidewalk works well.

05/05/2023,United States,5,Amazon Customer,So glad we bought this stroller,"I spent a few hours looking and reading about different compact strollers. I wanted to find one that was compact, comfortable for my 2 year old, and one that didn't cost a fortune. We took this stroller to New York City and it was perfect for my 2 year old. She was comfy and we loved that the seat reclines into different positions so she was able to nap on the go. The stroller was easy to fold up once you figured it out, and quick to hop in and out of ubers. This stroller was a lifesaver for our trip!!

04/25/2023,United States,3,Amazon Customer,Short backboard,"This stroller seems great, except the short backboard makes it uncomfortable for both of my average height children (3yo and 5yo). When sitting upright, as long as they’re looking around it’s fine, but if they try to rest their heads back, the edge digs in. It’s much worse when reclined, they’d need a blanket folded and covering the top edge of the back to make it usable.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39PDEVAKRB2HG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,0,B07NZPT3TR,Style: City Tour 2 Stroller | Color: Pitch Black

04/20/2023,United States,5,Marian Stangby,So far so good.,"I bought this stroller for my currently 7 months old baby. We have the Chicco Bravo, and even though we love it because it's big and comfy, it takes up the entire trunk in our suv, it’s heavy, bulky and won’t fit in a plane cabin. I researched for a while and decided to give the baby jogger a try. An easy to fold, small to bring in cabin and sturdy stroller were a must since we plan on traveling by plane very often, plus we also want it for everyday use. Pros: FOOTREST! Our big full size stroller doesn’t have this, and it’s a must for taking naps. It’s easy to fold, and folds very small which is impressive. It came fully assembled and just had to put in the wheels which took me less than 30 seconds. I like the almost flat recline back rest. When pushing, it feels very lightweight compared to my big stroller. People have complained about the harness, but all the pieces came together and don’t detach easily so that’s fast too. Cons: basket is VERY small, but it’s a travel stroller so that’s understandable. On our big stroller we have a large basket where we can fit 2 backpacks but I believe this one can only hold a small purse. The canopy could be larger because the sun hits directly on baby’s chest.I’ll be using it for a couple months before we travel and I’ll edit the review if necessary.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81y-5HAsmnL._SY1600.jpg,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G6TOS4WZKM22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,7,B07NZPT3TR,Style: City Tour 2 Stroller | Color: Pitch Black
03/29/2023,United States,5,Katie N,Great compact stroller,"I researched which compact stroller to buy. We currently have a Doona car seat stroller and she is getting ready to upgrade to her convertible seat. I wanted something to leave in the car and use when we travel. I already have a baby jogger city select and a stroller wagon so spending another few hundred dollars on a stroller, it had to be worth it. When this stroller is open, it’s actually pretty spacious, it’s not as small as the usual umbrella stroller.This stroller is “easy” to fold- can be one handed but two is easier. My 10 month old loved it. She was very comfortable in the stroller and has plenty of room to grow with it. I immediately took it outside and pushed it through our yard including the gravel we have- pushed just fine. Bumpy but didn’t get stuck. The features are very easy to use and so is assembly.I work for an airline so being compact when folded was very important to me. This stroller would fit in majority of the planes as a carry on.

01/27/2023,United States,2,Lolo,A disappointing stroller from a great brand,"I am a BIG Baby Jogger stroller fan. I own 2 different models, and I use them constantly. They are sturdy, reliable, and the customer service from Baby Jogger cannot be beat. When it came time to try an ultra-compact stroller for an upcoming trip, I was absolutely sure that the City Tour 2 would be the right stroller for us.I was so disappointed to get the stroller and experience how wobbly it is. The front wheels clack loudly and shake with each roll, even on a totally smooth indoor surface. I checked the wheels several times to make sure it wasn't an issue with installation - it's just how they are made.Compared to other ultra-compact strollers we tried, the folding mechanism is also cumbersome and awkward. I also wish that it would fold in a way that didn't require the removal of the wheels to fit in an airplane's overhead bin.On the bright side, the seat seems very comfortable and sturdy. The brake is easy to use. The fabric seems sturdy. It's offered at a great price point, and the inclusion of a travel bag is a great perk.Basically, this is an otherwise great stroller with an absolutely terrible set of wheels and a bad folding mechanism. Using this stroller on a busy travel day would drive me crazy.

12/12/2022,United States,3,Erin Kopacz,Compact/lightweight travel stroller with flaws,"Pros: compact and lightweight (usually fits in overheard on airplane)Cons: not easy enough fold/unfold (sometimes requires two hands or using your foot to kick it out to pop into place), wheels are cheap and meant for very smooth surface only, uncomfortable for baby.1) It takes some getting used to to pop it open and close it up - Often a 2 handed operation. 2) One of the wheels rattles and the wheels aren't meant to be taken even on sidewalks, let alone brick or off road. Makes for a noisy and bumpy ride. 3) my son is always so uncomfortable in this stroller - the back is basically a hard cardboard and then the slightest bit of padding. He squirms and wines a lot in it.Would recommend a product with wheels that aren't flimsy plastic so they don't make noise and can handle more than a perfectly smooth surface. Also a stroller with a more comfortable seat for baby - not sure mine will ever nap in this, and he's pretty low key. But if you just want something lightweight that is easy to travel on planes with...then this fits the bill.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P6QGX1VTJ04J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,1,,

12/01/2022,United States,4,Dan,So close to being great,"This stroller is so nearly perfect for travel. I used it on one short trip and it was awesome for manuevering one handed through the airport while I wheeled luggage in the other hand. My XL toddler fit well in the seat. The buckle was initially a hassle but I figured out a hack for just keeping the 2 side pieces permanently together so I wasn't trying to fit all 4 pieces together every time. The basket below is okay not amazing because it won't fit a full size backpack, but neither will any ultra compact travel stroller that I'm aware of. It folds down pretty compact and is relatively light and easy to carry, especially with the nice bag that's provided. The deal breaker for me was the fold. The buttons to activate the fold were so stiff I couldn't manage them one handed. And even with two hands I constantly struggled to get the folding mechanism to activate. I don't have weak hands but this thing really requires a lot of fumbling and that is just not okay when you are trying to get it folded quickly in a jet bridge or any other situation where you don't want to spend a full minute cursing quietly as strangers offer to help you while you're struggling. Perhaps this would have loosened up over time, but this stroller was meant to be a travel companion to make life easier, not our daily driver, so I didn't want to struggle with it every time we really needed it. Even all that said, I may have still sucked it up and kept it if I hadn't gotten a great deal on a Joolz Aer, which folds SO much easier and is comparable in all other aspects to this model.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7146halhsGL._SY1600.jpg,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2412OKI28KXJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,15,B07NZPT3TR,Style: City Tour 2 Stroller | Color: Pitch Black

I came across this stroller and decided to order it on sale on cyber monday. After previously owning the uppababy vista I was tired of lugging around a bigger stroller while on trips. This stroller is excellent quality great frame and fabric. Easy to steer! Pretty easy to fold and unfold however I still personally need to use both hands and I'm not sure if I just need to get used to it. Handled our uneven roads and sidewalks pretty good even grass and gravel pretty decently. Overall I'm very impressed with this stroller for the price and quality you get!

11/07/2022,United States,1,Kotaro Fujimaki,A wheel broke after 5 moths of usage,"I believe many people write their reviews shortly after they receive their products. Here, I write a review after using Baby Jogger® City Tour™ 2 Ultra-Compact Travel Stroller for 5 months. I should note that we used it almost everyday and not just for travel purposes, and we mostly kept the stroller on paved sidewalks.Overall, I am very disappointed by this stroller because of its apparent low durability. After 4 months of usage, the left wheel broke. The black metal piece that held the wheel apparently fell off and went missing. We bought a replacement wheel for $45. However, the same thing happened to the other side of the wheel a month later. I attached the photo of the wheel with the missing piece; the red dashed circle is where the metal piece was.Besides the fragility of its wheels, I really liked the maneuverability of this stroller and its light weight, which made it easy to carry my child in a busy city like Boston.

11/03/2022,United States,4,Michelle P.,"A Solid 4.5 Stars, Excellent Alternative to YoYo","I have been using this stroller for 4 months, since my daughter was 4 months old. I wanted an alternative to the expensive YOYO2 that we could use for flying as well as our daily keep-in-the-car stroller for errands. It has met all my general expectations and it's half the price of the YOYO. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:Small. Fits in airline overhead bins at least on large planes. The photo shows it fitting in the few inches of space in the back of my 2014 Kia Sorento with the 3rd row seats up.Easy to fold up. I usually use 2 hands to complete the process but the first mechanism can be done one handed. Technically you could probably do it all one handed, but two helps.Easy to maneuver with one handFoot rest and reclineNice sun shade with mesh peekaboo windowMy 4.5 year old fits it in too in a pinchComes with carrying bag for travelCons:Unfolding is easy but not graceful. The thing kind of flies open and I've had pieces of it hit me on the shin multiple times.The straps/buckles are awkward as heck. I don't know what kind of sadist designed the buckles to come apart into 4 separate pieces, but I've had to puzzle them back together like the magic scarab beetle in Aladdin before I can buckle it up properly quite a few times. I'm planning to try some duct tape on the backside of the buckle pieces to see if that will hold them together better. This is a small annoyance but my biggest pet peeve about this stroller.The seat is easy to lower (recline) using one hand, but to lift it back up into a more upright position again takes two and a little fiddling. That mechanism is very basic.The seat itself is a very flat piece of material with nothing that contours to the baby in any way, so I always think my daughter looks a little lopsided in it. She seems happy enough in it though. Maybe less of an issue for older babies and toddlers who hold themselves up better.No cupholder or anything on the handle bar, but this is not a deal breaker for meSmall basket, but it's a compact stroller, what do you expect?This worked great for us in the airport and on several international flights. I can't guarantee it would fit in the overhead bin on a smaller plane, but on long hauls you are good to go! It's light, folds easy, and maneuvers really well for such a compact stroller. I'm glad I bought it and saved a bunch of money compared to the YOYO, but have to take off half a star or so for the annoying buckle situation.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818qBM0clGL._SY1600.jpg,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AKS5HIIEMIVT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,45,B07NZPT3TR,Style: City Tour 2 Stroller | Color: Pitch Black

This thing is great because it’s lighter weight and it folds easy. The one thing that could be better is the carrying bag that comes with it. There is a specific way you have to place the stroller into the bag in order to fit it properly, otherwise it is highly frustrating. If the carrying bag is slightly better and came with a thicker shoulder pad, then this would be 5-stars. Also, if the sleeping position can drop a bit more, it would be great.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFAHE2UJVEUR3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,2,,

08/25/2022,United States,4,Michael Johnson,Overall great compact stroller.,"This is a great compact stroller that feels pretty sturdy and durable. I compared it against the mountain buggy nano, and cybex libelle. I eliminated the cybex because even though it had the most compact fold, it felt rickety and way cheaper than the others. It clearly won't last as long as the others. The mountain buggy nano was really good too, but I felt like it had so much extra fabric around the canopy that I found myself having to tuck away all the extra fabric around the chair whenever my daughter sat in it. I also thought the fold wasn't as easy and quick as I thought it was going to be. I kind of had to force it closed each time. The fabric also seemed like it would be less dirt and stain resistant.As for the baby jogger it is compact enough to take on a plane, it folds super easily, and the fabric is easy to clean. My only complaints are that I wish the seat back was a little longer and went higher up to accommodate a growing toddler/child, it also would have been nice if it could stand on its own in the folded position, and I wish the carry bag was more fitted and hand backpack straps and a handle. The bag makes the stroller look much larger than it is.I hope someone finds this review helpful!",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BEEZASQ1OW55/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,26,B07NZPT3TR,Style: City Tour 2 Stroller | Color: Pitch Black
08/25/2022,United States,4,Meg,Pretty good trade-off,"Doesn’t seem quite as compact as I thought it would be by the pictures, but definitely still smaller and lighter than my full size Chicco Bravo. It’s a little dangerous to unfold - it sort just all comes flying out with one touch. But it’s very roomy once unfolded, baby doesn’t seem crunched up and it’s still comfortable to push around, even for my large husband. He doesn’t feel hunched over or like he’s pushing a Barbie cart. I wish the wheels were a little sturdier to provide a bit of a smoother, sturdier ride. It’s a little dinky in that regard. Of course, sturdier wheels would mean larger wheels, which would take away from the compactness, so it’s a trade off you have to make",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQWH78G7QB32U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,4,B07NZPT3TR,Style: City Tour 2 Stroller | Color: Pitch Black

We used it as our every day stroller for 3 weeks and it handled uneven sidewalks without problems. It feels well made, not rickety.

04/06/2022,United States,1,Ewa,Offensively bad,I can’t believe so many like this stroller. It misses the mark on almost every single thing a parent needs. There is nowhere to attach a fan or a stroller umbrella. It doesn’t come with a bar ( for an already pricy stroller you have to pay extra to get it). It feels extremely cheap and plasticky. It’s nearly impossible to adjust the recline with a child inside.

03/22/2022,United States,4,Amazon Customer,Great lightweight stroller.,Great option for a light weight stroller. Takes some practice to open but it’s definitely a one hand fold. When it’s folded you can use the strap to carry around but it does not have a shoulder strap unless you use the travel bag. I was able to easily maneuver the stroller with one hand holding my baby. It handled well in a few different terrains without feeling flimsy. The folded size makes it easy to fit in a trunk or a crowded restaurant. The seat is very shallow but my daughter doesn’t mind and I can put up the footrest to make her more comfortable. Probably for an older/taller child this might not be as comfortable.

I wanted to avoid gate-checking (and any damage that might result), and this stroller makes it possible. It's also much more comfortable than the standard umbrella stroller.I would recommend for older babies or toddlers who can sit up pretty well. This stroller doesn't offer much support for littles who can't sit up well. You'd have to include an insert to support a little baby and that would hinder the easy collapse.Full disclosure, we have a different stroller for every day use that our infant carrier clips into.

11/11/2021,United States,5,aj399,"great-looking and light stroller, easy to maneuver with 1 hand","Bought this stroller for a trip since my larger non-travel one was not cutting it in airports and on trains. Read some reviews of various strollers, settled on this one. I love it! It worked really well as an airport and city stroller, I did not attempt to bring it on board so I gate-checked it, which was very convenient. I had to fold it up while holding my 2 year old and our bags several times and it really was fast/fairly easy to do with 1-ish hands (I may have put her down for a second to get it going but that's more a comment on my skills). The wheels come on and off really easily, which I think is an undersold point- it has a click-in-place/lever release system so it takes only seconds - highly convenient as well. When folded, it has this handle that is where the base of the seat is when unfolded and it is very easy to pick it up and carry it, otherwise you need to lay it down (doesn't stand on its own as other reviewers said) but I didn't find that to be such a problem so far. The basket below is adequate and the ability to lower the seatback works well enough as well- my child has napped in it with the seatback down so I can attest it is at least comfortable to sleep in. I also happen to love this color and the overall look. 5 stars all around. Wish I had bought this travel stroller pre-covid when we were doing a lot of train travel.

10/30/2021,United States,5,Kira Jankowski,"The convenience of a (almost) full sized stroller, but so light and compact!","We bought this stroller for upcoming trips in December and February, and were really concerned about getting a stroller that would be a breeze to fly with, but still look like a normal stroller and have all the amenities we are used to with our everyday stroller. I think we definitely found it with this stroller!Assembly was quick, out of the box it took about 5 minutes to unfold, clip in the wheels and lock them into place. We got the all black version of the stroller and it looks really sleek. It's super light and the added carrying bag will be really nice for when we are in airports and need to tuck the stroller away when boarding a flight, especially if we aren't able to store it in an overhead bin and will need to gate check it.As we haven't used it fully yet, some pros out of the box:- Really lightweight and the positioning of the handle bar is nice. I'm 5'3 and my husband is 6'2 and we both can comfortably push this and maneuver it.- It's also very narrow, which again will be convenient when traveling. With our other sturdier stroller, the back wheels stick out quite a bit and I'm always bumping the stroller into things when we go out to stores and such.- Love the fact that the seat can fully recline and the sun shade covers a decent amount. It's comparable to our Evenflo stroller for shade coverage. The adjustable foot rest is really nice and easy to use.- While I don't think it's foldable with one hand, it isn't hard to break down the stroller and fold it up.- Included carrying case is nice for keeping it stored and clean. Also has a strap for easy carrying on the case.- It folds down so small and compact! Our other stroller we need to put a seat down in our GMC Acadia to fit it in the trunk (which is so small) and really inconvenient for our older kids that sit in the back. This folds down so compact it fits in our very limited space in the trunk area.- It looks like a normal stroller. Some of the other compact strollers that we looked into are so weird looking when fully unfolded. I like that it just looks like your standard stroller.- It's very sturdy feeling for a compact stroller. It's a good middle ground between a higher quality umbrella stroller and an everyday/bulkier stroller.Some cons:- The underneath basket is pretty small. I think we'd be able to comfortably put a spare blanket or two under there, and maybe a few stray items. It definitely is not large enough for a full diaper bag, but that's not a deal breaker for us.- The chest clip/5 point harness is a little cumbersome to use. It breaks apart into separate pieces, and can be a little tricky to line up just right to clip. If your kid is struggling or wiggly, it can be a little difficult to get all the pieces together. I wish you could lock the top straps into place instead of just sliding them into the clips- It is a little tricky to unfold. We had looked at this stroller in the store prior to buying online, and the sales lady said you can just flip the stroller really hard and it'll open and lock into place. I don't think this is the case at all. There's a clip on the side you need to release to unfold it completely, and even then sometimes the folding points don't lock together when opening it up on the first time. I think it would be super difficult to open this one handed or if you were holding a baby. It takes me two hands. But once you know what you are doing it's not hard to open.- It's a little difficult to carry if you aren't using the carrying bag.

10/21/2021,United States,5,Amazon Customer,Perfect for Disney!,"We were taking our 6 month old son to Disney for the first time because we're psychos and needed a good stroller for long days. This stroller was perfect for packing for a 7 hours road trip because it folds up SO small, and my son was comfortable the entire trip. The storage space underneath isn't huge, but it was big enough to keep rain jackets and a small bag. Love that he could almost fully recline when he fell asleep. Our usual stroller is a Mockingbird, and this stroller felt like a smaller version of that. Easy to roll, very smooth ride, and made our trip a lot easier than taking our big stroller would have been.

The wheels don't have suspension so it is kind of wobbly (a little bit; may be that would not matter to you at all!!)

10/12/2021,United States,4,LavPebbles,Smooth ride but not easy to open up,"We wanted a lightweight stroller that lasts over 40 lbs, and this is the best that I can find at a reasonable price (got for $160 on sale).Took it to SeaWorld for our first use. I have twins, so we bought two separate single strollers. One of the shoulder straps came off when the string came loose. Don’t know how that happened, but within the first hour of riding it came off. My 25 lb little girl was sitting on it. Called customer service and it took forever for them to answer, but when I got connected the lady was able to help me.The ride was very smooth. Even when my daughter didn’t want to sit in it, I can hold her hand and maneuver the stroller with my other hand.The compartment under the stroller is small, so don’t expect to fit a diaper bag down there. Maybe a very flat small one.It was easy to fold down and is lightweight. I bought cupholders to strap on the back and when folded down, it didn’t get stuck or anything.My kids are 35 inches tall, so their feet will stick out when they’re laying down.The cons are:-Stroller doesn’t stand up when folded down, so you’ll have to lay it flat on the hood or the seat part, which can get dirty if laying on the ground.-Opening it up is cumbersome because it doesn’t pop out easily. You have to remember to catch the front wheels, so that the seat doesn’t fold back down and touch the ground. I’m only 110 lbs with not much strength, so opening it up takes practice.-The seat doesn’t have a good upright position, so my kids had to lean forward if they didn’t want to rest back on it because it reclines too much on the most upright position.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81u3gQG1iEL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91abGr4Yo8L._SY1600.jpg",,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYZ4I6S72QB2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,2,B07PMSS9NF,Style: City Tour 2 Double Stroller | Color: Pitch Black

We use a Mockingbird stroller for our everyday stroller and I thought hey this will be a good second option. NOPE, we are making the switch permanently. Our little due loved it. I think he liked being a little closer to the ground as well. I particularly love that the bottom bar between the two wheels is set back a bit, so I don't kick it when I walk. I also like that the front wheels and rear wheels are all aligned, with our Mockingbird the rear wheels are wider and I am constantly under calculating the width of the stroller. Glides like butter and the handle is at a perfect height. I am 5'6. I can't even tell you how many times I have opened and closed this stroller already and I've had it for less than 24 hours.

I have a small car (new Subaru Crosstrek) and when I got this car it became so hard to find a sturdy but also light and compact stroller to fit the trunk area. This was literally my last option as it was the only one small enough to fit the car. Well it’s phenomenal. Both of my girls are quite tall for their age as well and that makes finding a stroller tall enough in the seat department to fit them and not crunch their heads in the awning. This one has a tall seat area that will definitely accommodate them for the next few years. I’m also so glad it doesn’t take up the WHOLE trunk. Who has time for that? No one! You need space for the rest of your junk and groceries! This thing definitely allows for that and that is a huge win to me! I cannot say enough good about it. What a relief to find a great stroller that fits in the car and for my tall girls! Buy this thing if you have a small trunk and or tall kiddos! It’s so worth it!!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1vnDQpk0ES._SY1600.jpg,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MYPBEE1U1OK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,1,,

I keep this City Mini Tour 2 in my car all the time. It’s perfect!! We also use it when traveling snd don’t need a huge stroller.

The adjustable footrest is awesome and it reclines near flat. Love how it folds and fits in the travel bag. The basket is small in comparison but it will hold necessities.

01/21/2021,United States,5,Kayla C.,Easy for a mom on the go,"We had a Graco travel system when my daughter was born. I hated the stroller that came with it. It was so bulky, hard to fold and wide that it made maneuvering it extremely hard. Being a first time mom I never really thought to research strollers or what to look for when you are testing one out. The Graco took up all the trunk space in my Jeep Compass that I couldn't even put groceries in the trunk with it. I was in need of a lighter, easier to fold and just more livable stroller. I don't really like the look of umbrella strollers I wanted something with a sun shade, and the capabilities to be able to go to a store, fold in the trunk, go for a walk just an overall light weight every day stroller. We didn't purchase this for travel or anything like that but it is perfect for that as well. It folds so small, is soooo light weight and easy to fold and put up. I just found out I am pregnant with baby #2 so we will for sure be buying the Baby Jogger double stroller seeing as how great of quality this stroller is. I am so happy I purchased this.

This is lightweight, chic looking, and easy to carry with one hand. It's not super wide like most doubles, but also has enough room for my kids to be comfortable. My favorite feature: my kiddos absolutely love being right next to each other and kept laughing, hopefully this will help me when we are grocery shopping! It is easy to maneuver and drives much smoother than I expected. At first it was hard to fold, but after several times I figured it out and now it's much easier. I really like how compact the stroller folds too, it's kind of amazing how small it looks when folded! My 2 year old loved how we could adjust the leg support so she could put her feet up, after a hard day of playing of course. The bottom basket is pretty small and can't fit my diaper bag, but that's the only negative I've found so far.

07/09/2020,United States,5,GA Reviewer,Folds up flat and square- very compact shape. Smooth rolling. Terrible strap snaps.,"We used to own a baby jogger style Stroller as a go to stroller- a big 3 wheel vehicle that took up my whole SUV trunk and a big part of a pickup bed and now with this stroller I’m literally in shock about how SMALL this folds up. It’s about the size of a really big diaper bag. I have a trunk back! I can finally put groceries in there- so exciting.I’ve owned probably about 5 strollers by now a few kids in and I will say this is also SUPER easy to open and close, get in and out of trunk, etc. Some of my other strollers were HEAVY and were honestly too hard to maneuver postpartum (c section healing). This is LIGHT compared to most others. It’s heavier than a standard fabric and frame umbrella stroller but way lighter than any jogger or double stroller I’ve had. Which is amazing considering there’s multiple positions for the kid and a small storage fabric tray under. I actually find it easier to open and close than a cheap standard umbrella stroller. This would be a great vacation/ airport stroller.It comes with a travel bag which although useful for travel, I don’t bother with it on a day to day basis. I usually just want to open and close fast in and out of trunk.It rolls very smooth and maneuvers great. Night and day easier over a bulky jogger or double strollers that I was using a lot.There’s no cup holders or any pockets or anything useful on the handle AND there’s a warning about not hanging things from it. I assume this is because if the stuff you are putting in it is too heavy you could tip it over (it’s pretty lightweight). I will honestly probably put a few accessories on it though- as a cup holder and phone holder would have been useful when I go for walks w/ baby- but I don’t think I could hang Shopping bags from it like my intense heavy double stroller.The seat folds all the way down flat so baby can lap flat (nice). I had trouble figuring how to get it back up To sitting again on my own and left the kid laying down because I couldn’t figure it out when in use- but my husband seemed to figure it out with no issues.The straps are a total pain. I own a million strollers and about 7 car seats and high chairs, etc- so I’m used to these different straps from different brands- but these are just plain annoying. There are two top pieces that need to slide into middle pieces and then those go into a middle. Excerpt those top shoulder straps are super hard to slide into the side ones- and when getting multiple kids out of a car in a parking lot I’ve literally just only strapped in his sides around the waist because I don’t have the time to curse and fumble and mess with these shoulder straps. If they slid in smoother it would be fine- but it’s TIGHT and hard to line up because everything is black. I could see struggling with this part if I had my fake nails on. This would be a hard strap for my mother too w/ arthritis issues.I even used this seat at beach and walked baby around then dragged this through the sand under a tent and baby napped on the beach for an hour laying down on this like a nap cot.Overall I’d recommend it.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+m3l8BabL._SY1600.jpg,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32HSA0B0X9OLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,2,B07NZPT3TR,Style: City Tour 2 Stroller | Color: Pitch Black

This basically means developmentally she's perfect but her communication is very delayed so when it comes to travel or quick trips it is safer to use a stroller still. My checklist was simple. I wanted a compact fold, I didn't want her to be cramped in it, I wanted some storage as it will only be used a couple times a month and have no need of a full time stroller (daily trips ect she just holds hands and walks) so far this has been perfect. I ordered this and the graco pace lightweight and this easily won out. If you need a full time stroller I would suggest the city mini or mini gt, graco modes or the britax was also amazing when my kids were younger.

Super light folds for the most part easy. Takes up very little space in my trunk. However when folding it the button at the top the claps the canopy part, does tend to stick a little although the more I use it the looser and better it is getting. Super light. I bought the converter clips in order to attach my graco click connect 35. I'm in love with this stroller. I will say however it does only go up to 45 pounds so probably need to get another stroller when my baby is a an older toddler.

02/18/2020,United States,4,MMBH,Great stroller. Not a jogger though.,"With four kids, we've used lots of different strollers and wagons over the years. This is our third double stroller. So far, I'm very happy with it. It's relatively lightweight, easy to open and close, and maneuvers well! It also rides very smooth and my kids seem to be quite comfortable riding in it. One thing I was weary of is whether or not this would fit inside a doorway (because I've owned side-by-side double strollers and in fact do not fit inside doors). So far, we've had no issues with it getting stuck and can pretty much enter any door way without doing weird tricks or turns. It's definitely a great stroller for both small and bigger kids. My 6 year old has sat in it with not issues as well as my 2 and 4 year olds.My only complaint is that I think calling this a jogger is a little deceiving. I'm a runner and have used a couple different running strollers over the years. I would never run with this.

I have a 3-wheel tandem double stroller, but the poor kid in the back doesn't get to see much, so this is nicer because no one is in front of the other. Love that the seats individually recline and the calf rests can be adjusted independently of the other side. The canopies are large & cover a good area. The stroller is light weight and easy to maneuver, but does pull toward the side with the heaviest child. It does not steer as easily as the 3-wheel stroller- perhaps because that one has all terrain tires. Being so slim, a larger child is not going to be comfortable in this, and it is recommended up to age 2. But for the most part, as my children get older/larger, they want to walk anyway. I think this is great for someone with twins or children close in age/size.

Each have their Pros and Cons, and how does this Baby Jogger fare?PROS- Fairly lightweight- Comparable pricing- Comfortable seats- Fits through most doors- Folds easily and uses less space than two, separate strollers- Takes up VERY little space- Cargo space available- Smooth tires (initially)- Sun shade for both children are generously sized and come down quite a bit- Near-flat recline for napping (they work independently from the other)- Three-point safety harnesses- Leg support with adjustable angles- Rated for children up to 2 years/33 lbs each- Compatible with optional carry cotsCONS- One of the front tires became difficult to turn after having taken the stroller through some graveled terrain. All 4 wheels used to turn smoothly on concrete, but not any more- Suffers from the same issue as other side-by-side strollers when occupied by two children of vastly different weights (see NOTES below)- Can be considered pricey for some, but the ability to only push one instead of two strollers is well worth the convenience- Does not come with cup holders for neither the parent nor the toddlers, though you can buy third party accessories for the parent side- No cart seat attachment, though car seat stroller straps work- Cargo space is a bit on the small sideNOTES- If the stroller is used only for smooth, concrete terrain, the wheels should last for a long time and provide for a smooth ride. Do not use them over rough terrain, such as gravel as I did, or you could potentially damage one or more wheels- Four-wheeled design makes it harder to jog with, but much more stable for strolling around the city. For jogging, get the three-wheeled designs for easier, one-handed maneuverability- Like many side-by-side strollers, if both children are vastly different in weight, the heavier toddler will skew the stroller to turn more towards that side. You can easily compensate for that, however. Front-to-back strollers do not have that problem, but they suffer from the child sitting at the back from not being able to see what is going on up frontAll in all, this double stroller works well, but the reliability and hardiness of the wheels are questionable in the long-run, particularly for rough terrain.",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPFQ34IH3SGGD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,6,B07PMSS9NF,Style: City Tour 2 Double Stroller | Color: Pitch Black

That being said if there is a big difference between the kids in weight you will feel it when taking turns. My kids are about 8lbs apart and I FEEL it. It’s much easier taking turns if kids are close in weight. Seats can individually recline nearly flat and calf support can be adjusted to flat position so the kids can actually get a good sleep in this stroller. Canopy is generously sized but I don’t like the peakaboo window because it makes noise when opening. I woke my baby up twice. I just try not to completely close it to avoid the velcro making noise. Ride is smooth and the stroller turns easily. It’s narrow enough for our narrow sidewalks and I have no issues with the clearance like I do with the full size double stroller. Folding and unfolding is easy but it’s not exactly one hand operation, at least not for me and not yet. All things considered, functionality and ease of use I consider this to be a very good and fairly lightweight stroller. This will not last for kids pass 2yr old as the seats will get narrow.

01/19/2020,United States,4,Adam Shields,"Very light for a double stroller, narrow so easy to maneuver, but the storage is too small","I have had a lot of strollers over the years as a nanny and then my own kids. This is a very light, easy to fold double stroller. It folds pretty flat so that you can put it in a trunk without it taking up too much space. It is good for use on a bus or public transportation where you need to squeeze in beside it.There are two negatives to it. One, when putting it up, there are two different points that have to be clicked in and both need to be manually put into place. Some strollers just unfold and automatically click into place. This one needs you to move it into place. Which if you have a second adult with you, is not a big deal. If you don't that takes some effort if you are putting it up while managing two little kids.Second problem is that the under stroller storages is very small. I tend to bring a backpack as a diaper bag or carrying whatever I need. Because of how narrow the opening is, I needed to use a smaller backpack and it takes more effort to get it into the storage area. I used another similar style stroller a few weeks ago and it had a significantly larger strorage area and I missed that.This does not come with a cup holder, but there is a space to hang one. That being said, these type of cup holders tend to fall off and get lost fairly easily so I am not surprised that one did not come with it.Now the positives. It is small, narrow and easy to get through doors. It is as light as any double stroller that I have used. But that lightness and narrowness is in part because it is designed for kids up to 33 each. Larger kids both will be uncomfortable because the seats are too narrow and because the stroller will likely crack a wheel or stop turning correctly if it is regularly used with too much weight.The sunshades come way down and the seats lay nearly flat. That along with the feet area locking into a flat position makes this a great stroller for kids to nap in.There is not a cup holder or pocket for kids. The kids that are using this probably are too small to use those on their own anyway, but I know for my 4 year old (he is about 40lbs) he wants a pocket or something to put his stuff.There is a good lock on the wheels and the turning works well as long as it is not overloaded.",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27X5C2A26I5WI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,0,B07PMSS9NF,Style: City Tour 2 Double Stroller | Color: Pitch Black

(Max Limit: 33lbs/side),"Love how slim the stroller is and it looks quite nice too with the canopy - fits through doorways fine, fairly easy to maneuver for a double stroller. The product description says for 0-24 months and the max limit per side is 33 pounds (for reference that's about how much my 2.5 year old weighs), so works best if your kids are close in age or twins. The weight limit is quite low, so unless your kid is smaller, this wouldn't be recommended for anyone 3 years and up. It's also quite narrow, so they wouldn't fit comfortably. The reclining is pretty good, reclines a decent amount so baby's can nap. It's a little difficult to open and close (only because it is larger than a single stroller) but considering the size, still quite easy to do. Simply press the top handlebar and move another button left while adjusting the stroller - and it becomes quite compact in seconds!

The top of the box comes up to my knees and I am 5’4” so I knew the actual stroller would be smaller. I was excited about that part because as a new parent I’m not quite sure how to navigate with something so large as I’m petite.

We tried pushing it on wood floors, concrete, and carpet and encountered zero issues, the flow is nice and smooth. I have a Graco car seat to use with this and that was fun… I’ll probably look at another car seat for this stroller.

The stroller is definitely not for carrying on your shoulder all day or even for 5 to 10 minutes.

It’s a 2 step folding process.I was looking to get the mountain buggy nano or a uppababy and others. But we narrowed down on city tour 2. If you have a big size kid, always trying to break something, constantly moving in the stroller, need some extra space within the sitting area to have something to keep and play, reclinable leg rest like in a reclining chair this stroller just has all that.It does not wobble like the nano or other strollers. True to Baby Joggers brand name it is built sturdy yet lightweight. Ofcourse amazon sells it so returns are easy.The height of the stroller is just right for tall people. Ofcourse for all others it’s the most comfortable.

11/17/2019,United States,5,An Earthling,Most compact stroller I’ve ever seen.,"I’ll start by saying that I’ve owned enough strollers to outfit a daycare, and this is by far the most compact luxury stroller I’ve ever seen. I couldn’t believe the size of the box when the stroller arrived, even my husband commented and asked “is that the stroller?”My little one is 4, not so little anymore, so I can’t attest to how it works for a baby, but for a toddler, the stroller is great. He is close to maxing this thing out, but he seems to enjoy it.The wheels are great, nice rotation so you can easily maneuver around. I’ve always been a big fan off 4 wheeled strollers, seem much more safe, easier to move, and easier to get up or down a curb.The peek thru window at the top of the canopy is really nice. I’ve seen it before in my other high end strollers and I’ve always appreciated that I can look at my top kids cute little head while scooting around town. The foot extension is a really neat feature that I’ve never seen before. I suspect it’s more for little ones, because it doesn’t exactly work out for my 4 year old, but I’m sure he would have loved it a couple years ago.Overall, really great stroller, I would have liked to have this years ago because of the foot extension feature.

11/15/2019,United States,4,"Oliver DeMille, TJEd",3.5 stars: Compact and maneuverable; limited - rated up to 20lbs.,"I was seduced by the Baby Jogger name, and thought of this as a jogging stroller - but it's really not. It's compact, lightweight, highly foldable and easy to work with - but it's not really suitable for a mixed-terrain jogging. The front wheels are just not big enough for that kind of a beating. And, this is not a full-sized stroller in the sense of the jogging stroller I was picturing; it's really only rated up to 20 lbs, so that's infant/small-toddler range. It's a bit precious for so limited use, in my opinion; when you're racing through an airport, you need something that a 3yo can sit in. Or a 4yo. This *might* be that, but probably not. That being said, as a travel stroller for small ones, it's excellent! Well-made.

   I ordered the 'Baby Jogger City Tour 2 Single Stroller, Jet' for our new Grandson. We wanted something small, compact and durable that would easily fit in my son's small vehicle. This Baby Jogger City Tour 2 works perfectly. It was super easy to assemble, which really only consisted of attaching the wheels. I love how easily it folds up and breaks down and it stores perfectly into the included carry case. The seat is super easy to adjust as is the foot rest and the buckle system works great and is also easy to adjust. The build and quality of this stroller is absolutely top notch and should last many years to come. I guess my only gripe would be that there is very little storage, which is under the seat but that is totally to be expected for the size of this jogger. Overall I feel that the Baby Jogger City Tour 2 is a great value though it is a bit on the pricey side, but it does make for a great investment whether for your own baby or as a gift.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813fV+s8mzL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814wA1Rx4nL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818eBubdczL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819rtsBHPIL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NmZv03DnL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81REw0vCbPL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81RpF3xT8IL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rQABXl5nL._SY1600.jpg",,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYNSK4VP3NMZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,26,B07NZPT3TR,Style: City Tour 2 Stroller | Color: Pitch Black

11/09/2019,United States,5,Angie,Folds up Unbelievably small!,"The first thing you notice is just how small this full size stroller folds up to. It arrived in a box that was so small I thought I might need to do a lot of assembling, but nope. All I had to do was attach the wheels. both sets clicked into place so easily it took less than thirty seconds and required no tools. The unique folding mechanism means the stroller folds into thirds and is about the size of a large tote bag when it is finished. It is perfect for traveling (I would think it would fit in an overhead locker on a plane) and for maximizing the space in your boot. Unfolding is simple but takes a little practice simply because it folds differently to other strollers I have owned so you have to have a couple of practices to get the 'knack'.The buggy will accommodate your child from birth through to 4/5 years old. The back of the chair lies almost flat and the from raises to provide a secure 'bed' but you can also buy extra attachments (the Graco one was just under $20) so you can click in your car seat.The wheels are solid, so no tires to pump and the center of gravity is further forward than most strollers so no tipping!. The stroller is light and maneuverable, easy to control and steer with one hand. There is a small amount of storage - not very much- this is probably the sacrifice you have to make for it folding up so neatly.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71F3KMNhDxL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RJuqaM23L._SY1600.jpg",,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAJPIGAMV9838/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,1,B07NZPT3TR,Style: City Tour 2 Stroller | Color: Pitch Black

10/21/2019,United States,3,Ricardo & Krystal Torres,Baby Jogger City Tour 2 Seacrest,"I recieved the stroller today. I haven't taken out for a stroll yet. The stroller is lightweight. I'm going from using a Chicco Bravo stroller to the city tour. It definitely is something to get use to since the chicco is much more spacious. The latch used to lock the stroller only locks the bottom part of the stroller not the handle, so if I pick up the stroller from the handle instead of the strap it'll open up the stroller. The canopy is a little awkward, when I open it all the way and the seat is up all tr he way the canopy is really close to the child's face. The brakes are good. The push handle is comfortable. When I opened the back part of the stroller to readjust the straps you can see the back panel it's made of a plastic board as I'm sure a lot of stroller are. The storage basket is a joke. I have a skip hop diaper bag that I usually hang on the push handle but the city tour has a warning sign on the canopy to not hang bags from the handle. I don't see a diaper bag fitting in the basket. Plus this stroller doesn't come with a belly bar I had to purchase separate which is ridiculous considering the price.For the price of the stroller I expected a little more. I feel like I paid for the brand name more than the actual stroller.For an everyday stroller this is ok I wouldn't use it to travel. I prefer to check in my chicco and for my child and me to be comfortable during the trip since the chicco weighs a little more than this one.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715pv5CTWHL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71X6kGrYPLL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Qwirx48wL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gQJ-Kue0L._SY1600.jpg",,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LSZCZFP0GAHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,0,,

10/07/2019,United States,4,D. Sweet,"Compact/Travel Stroller - Not an Everyday Stroller, a few pointers!","From a Baby Jogger fan, this is a great travel stroller, but not a good everyday stroller in my opinion. I'm not a fan of the two-way break apart buckle for each side, that's just an extra hassle and I've considered super gluing the top piece into the second side piece. The seat back is almost too short for my 18 month old to rest his head on while riding, as you recline the seat the back pocket will sort of cradle their heads somewhat, but I can't imagine that being particularly comfortable. This being said, I didn't purchase this for my everyday stroller, but for a lightweight travel/shopping stroller alternative vs my older City Elite model (Summit sized version). I also have a the Double GT.If I were a new parent, searching for a stroller I would say this - I love my Elite, but it is big and heavy and I don't always need/want to carry the bulk, but when I want the features, it sure is nice! The City Mini GT wasn't out when I purchased the Elite, or I would have gotten that one for sure! The GT Double, is amazing, but also heavy. The functionality on both my Elite and GT Double is excellent and I love in every way. I have a smaller 7.5 year old that can still fit comfortably in either the Elite or the GT Double, and our 4.5 year old still fits just fine as well. The canopies are huge, and a really appreciated feature that is always needed to shade our kiddos!Overall the Tour 2 is obviously a small stroller, but if you are wanting a stroller to last throughout toddler-hood (and beyond when needed) - I would not recommend this one, but would advise to choose between the GT2 or the City Mini 2 which would last much longer, and provide a much more comfortable ride for your kiddos. The Tour 2 is all about convenience but doesn't offer the complete package of functionality, comfort, or the big canopy to shade my little one. The City Mini is just over 4 lbs heaver at 18.8 lbs, and is well worth the upgrade and the price tag (as is the GT, at 21.4 lbs). For the Tour 2, the ability to hold a car seat for travel would be a huge plus if we were in that stage still I must say, the fold is fantastic, maneuverability is wonderful, fabric should hold up and clean well, however, I do think the basket/material could feel a little more durable given these often get heavy use.If this is your travel/airport/shopping stroller, I'd look around for one that might accommodate a taller toddler for the head rest issue I see with this one - otherwise this is a great small stroller that boasts the ability to fit carry on requirements when traveling.Pictured, average size 18 month old, and 4.5 year old. And folded in my Honda Odyssey.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812sMWGaEaL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815ViMXvV9L._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81C1LJzrOML._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FiZ3BEK5L._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81HLc2Dxn4L._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81L7LbZOpfL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81c0rN2IPeL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81f3AJAIpxL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81nL9vaf1gL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81stlHIjKgL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tECWOJKTL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xrIOMQ6jL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91e-vufYCnL._SY1600.jpg",,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FWU8C41M2EEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,5,,

Originally I was going to buy the zozo but I couldn't get myself to spend yet another 800 dollars on a stroller. I am up to 4 :/ . Anyway, this stroller is way more affordable and just a great. It easy to close and store on a plan, car, and hotel. It was super comfortable for my daughter. She took so many naps in it on vacation.! Easy to maneuver and light.weight. I cannot say enough good things about this stroller.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JAWLTGTIOS3T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,0,,
08/13/2019,United States,4,SB,Good for strolling,"I have two children 22 months apart that are pretty close in weight. I like this stroller, it’s really slim, so really easy to get around places, smooth to push and lightweight. My friend’s much bigger toddler fit in it as well, but didn’t seem like it was super comfortable.Folding up is easy but opening it is so awkward. Maybe because I’m still getting used to it, but I got the biggest bruise on my leg the first time I opened it, and still haven’t gotten a good routine to open yet. Also when it is folded up you need to make sure not to grab it by the handle, but the seat straps. I feel like I’ll eventually figure it out but my shins are suffering in the meantime.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R346GLDJ1V6MLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,7,B07PMSS9NF,Style: City Tour 2 Double Stroller | Color: Pitch Black
07/31/2019,United States,2,Noel Morelen,I wanted to love this stroller so BAD!,"I loved the look of this stroller. It was beautifully designed. The shades are long enough to block the sun, the recline on each seat is amazing for your toddlers nap while out and about. The stroller is light (for a double stroller), the fold is small so it doesn’t take up much room in the trunk, it will also fit behind the driver seat since toddlers don’t need leg room. But the pros end there :(My children are 13 months apart so they have less than 10 pounds difference in weight for reference and the pull on the toddler side of the stroller was significant. Making it almost impossible to turn right. The side with the heavier toddler also squeaked so bad neither one of my kiddos could nap like I had planned. My toddler weighs just at 28 pounds and my younger baby weighs 20 pounds. The sun shades are velcro so trying to take a quiet peak at your babies is not suggested since the ripping sound would wake a sleeping adult, and leaving it open lets sun in which defeats the purpose of pulling the shade. Collapsing the stroller was tricky (maybe because it was new to me) but it’s definitely not a one hand, or one step process like some of the tutorials made it seem.Super disappointed as I had HIGH hopes for this stroller. It was returned after a days use because I could not justify all the flaws in a 400 stroller :(",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R5A2O4EIKLX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,41,B07PMSS9NF,Style: City Tour 2 Double Stroller | Color: Pitch Black

05/07/2019,United States,4,J.M.,"Great quiet buggy, very easy all way around","I uploaded a video as scarlet nova on YouTube but can’t seem to be able to do it here, maybe it’s too “heavy”. I’ll try to write everything...Our yoyo got stollen so I’ve ordered several strollers to choose from. I mean quite a few.. so far this is the beat option to replace our yoyo, I only have it 4 stares due to the fact that harness and the crotch buckle are not very nice, will be annoying for me to use for every day, the fabric is not easy to remove to wash, the back wheels are probably will be required to remove (that is easy) by some airlines. If you only buy for traveling by plane - take the older version, it’s 100% no hassle and very high quality back pack is included (if it’s for traveling only - could live with crotch issue, and the fabric is nicer on the old one too), if plan on using as a compact stroller for the car and having naps in parks - it can be a keeper! taking wheels off once twice a year is not a biggie if will be required (I checked it fits into some airlines size restriction and some of them it doesn’t, but if take those wheels off - it does!!!)))) about the fabric - it’s not as easy to take it off to wash as it is with Ergobaby Metro or yoyo, but it’s atill easier with your 2 than tour 1 I think.Just because tour1&2 are so neat and slim when folded they seem to be lighter than others although they are actually all about the same)))) I also liked that it’s 2 layers of fabric and the backrest seat recline adjusting strap runs between those layers, with Metro - it’s 1 layer of fabric and you can see the strap all the way around there on the sides...The harness is not detachable, btw, it’s stitched to the fabrics so you can’t replace it or a buckle.The button on the handlebar is made for a right handed person while the auto lock is located on the right hand as well (so you’d be holding the buggy with your left hand at that moment of unfolding it). Metro - the button on the handle it for left/right hand and the autolock is in the left side.The backrest seat is 1 in shorted than your 1 or Metro...that’s pretty much it..","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711EZfcDs6L._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EDqZ7J76L._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RRrQyvLpL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71afr6CzTuL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Ro2cS0RlL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81uJEegiVrL._SY1600.jpg",,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F83NH8FZTHEZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,128,,

The raised calf support is a bonus and makes it much more comfortable ride for the little one. Basket is small but you wouldn't expect it much bigger from a travel buggy. My only minor bit of criticism would be the front wheels (hence deducted one star) - they are quite noisy and plasticky in comparison to my city mini GT, and the back support could be a little taller. Overall I am very pleased with this- it's perfect travel buggy and to keep in the car for nipping out and about in the city. I don't think it's a buggy for long walks on unpaved roads.

04/16/2019,United States,5,Joanna P,"Lightweight, good quality, nice features","New baby update: I’ve been using this as an infant car seat stroller for my Chicco Key Fit with the belly bar and a nylon strap secured through the seat belt path. With the strap it is similar to other travel strollers with universal infant seat holders. I’ve been using a jogging stroller as my main stroller since quarantine started and this feels flimsy in comparison but I’m guessing similar to other snap and go frames. My 2.5 year old can still fit the seat and a small potty seat fits in the under basket.Update: after nearly a year of use, this stroller still performs great. The wheels squeak a bit and I have to pop the front wheels over uneven spots on the sidewalk, but I love how the stroller is sturdy but lightweight. I got the belly bar to attach a clip-on snack cup and to have a handle for carrying. My tall 19 month old fits but will probably exceed the height before the 44 lb weight limit.Original review: I bought this stroller to replace a City Mini GT with my 11 month old. We live in an old building with stairs to the sidewalk, and I could not manage a heavy stroller and baby on my own anymore. I went to a big box store and tried out other options (including the $400+ ones and the sub-$200 ones). The expensive ones are nicer but too expensive, and the cheaper ones feel low quality and uncomfortable for baby. I bought an Ergobaby Metro and the City Tour 2 to try at home and kept this one. This is a great middle-level travel stroller. This stroller pushes ok on uneven concrete and fair on dirt and low grass. On sidewalks and smoother surfaces, you can push one-handed. The folding mechanism isn’t as smooth as Ergobaby Metro or Uppababy Minu, but I can do it one handed now after using it a few weeks. Opening is also awkward but manageable holding my baby on my hip. The underseat storage will hold a medium-sized purse or small diaper bag. My backpack diaper bag would not fit. The canopy covers to about mid-torso (compared to ankle-level in the GT), so a raincover is a must. My son has sat in this stroller for errands and neighborhood strolls without complaint. The seat length is comparable to the Mountain Buggy Nano and it does dip a little to keep him from sliding out. I put up the leg rest for now since he is too short to overhang. I like that the seat back can go very upright, he likes looking around, but he can also grab the frame and pull himself almost out of the stroller so I keep the harness tight. The harness clips are annoying but seem secure. One nice feature is that once folded, if you tilt the front wheels sideways, this balances upright enough to lean on a wall (compared to the GT which was very prone to tipping when folded). The carry bag has a shoulder strap but no backpack straps, and they got rid of the zipper pouch in the storage basket and pocket behind the seat. I wish there was a built-in strap for carrying since the handle you pull to fold is a skinny and chafing piece of nylon. I’m giving this 5 stars because this is an amazing value for a travel stroller that looks and handles more like a full-sized stroller. For new parents, this can replace a caddy stroller and umbrella stroller (and maybe a full-sized stroller). I’ll update if needed after traveling with it this summer.",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20LMTXVDOQCEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,10,B07NZPT3TR,Style: City Tour 2 Stroller | Color: Pitch Black

The seat is deep and the foot rest is great! The recline is almost flat and my baby took 2 naps in it by chance yesterday!

I tried out this stroller in person at buy buy baby before I ordered it online (they did not have the Slate in store). here is pros and consPro:Very easy to maneuver with one handVery easy to foldCompact enough that I don't feel like I'm trying to squeeze a Hummer through the storeGreat canopyI was actually able to squeeze my book bag diaper bag underneath (a tight squeeze but it went in)Easy to use harnessVery nice reclince and foot restCons:The bag it came with is cheaply made with no backpack style straps.. so photos are misleading (they are NOT like the bag you get with the original city tour)The slate is ugly in person. I wanted a light colored fabric and this was the only optionOddly, even though it rides pretty smooth for an equivalent of an umbrella stroller, the front wheels are loud and make a weird noise.There is absolutely no suspension on the front wheels unlike the maxi Cosi or ergobaby metro version of this type of strollerConclusions: for my lifestyle this stroller works perfectly. If you are more of a city dweller meaning malls, smooth side walks, etc this thing is great. This is not going to go over anytime of playground mulch, grass, sand, etc even if you lock the wheels.This is a supped up umbrella stroller with the added bonus of near full recline, micro fold, and big canopy.I do not regret the purchase...

03/22/2019,United States,5,GMT23,BEST TRAVEL STROLLER ON THE MARKET,"I didn't buy this stroller on amazon but felt I needed to write a review due to the lack of reviews for this stroller out there. This is a relatively new stroller (came out in February). While I never used the original city tour, this review is solely for the new version (the tour 2). I live on the other side of the country with my family all back east and have traveled already 4x with my 6 month old. I am so relieved to have found a stroller that is a combination of all the travel strollers out there. I was pretty much buying a stroller than returning it after using it for one trip because the others are so impractical. I started with the Baby zen yoyo (i hated how you needed two hands to fold, the price and lack of storage). Then I tried the Uppababy minu (I use the Uppababy Vista as my primary full size stroller). I was really hoping to like it but it fell short since it was heavy and couldn't elevate legs so baby can nap. Then I tried the gbpockit plus. The only thing i liked about this stroller was the price, other than that its total garbage and very flimsy. I only used it for 1 round trip at airport because I was certain it would break since its so cheaply made. Then finally, i discovered the baby jogger city tour 2!It was honestly a relief and words don't describe how happy I am to have finally found one thats both functional and doesn't look strange. I love that it has a one hand fold (i can open and close it all while holding my baby). It has decent storage space, comes to a close full recline for naps, foot rest also comes up, and it doesn't feel like my son will tip over in it. My son seemed comfortable and didn't get fussy in the stroller. It has a nice stride and easy to maneuver. It also comes with a nice bag to store it in. Fantastic stroller and highly highly recommend if you are a frequent traveler looking for a nice carry on stroller (it fit in overhead for american airlines, jet blue and delta). Extra plus, it comes at fraction of the cost of the other more popular options.*I didn't try the mountain buggy because it felt cheap and reminded me too much of the GBpockit plus.",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15S341OO7D8A2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZPT3TR,143,,

Typically I baby wear but we have a giant 13 month old who’s over 27 lbs and 32 inches. So we needed a stroller a bit less bulky than the GT to travel with. I was leary of buying the first model of the City tour due to the complaints about shallow seat. However as this was one of the things addressed with the city tour 2, I went for it. After a 12 hour day at Disney, this thing delivers. Super light, narrow, easy to maneuver, quick to fold, decent basket for a stroller this compact, the full recline and popped foot rest were great for on the go naps, the seat depth was good for both my giant kid and my 4 year old niece. Sun shade is a bit small especially if the seat is as far forward/straight as it will go but it’s still decent. Very happy with our purchase!UPDATE: 6 months later still loving our city tour!

03/14/2022,Singapore,5,kyi p.,Brand new stroller; cheaper than retail,"it took me a long time to settle on this stroller. I wanted a stroller that's travel friendly, yet has features like lie flat recline, large canopy with SPF 50, adjustable foot rest, easy to fold, sturdy / reliable brand (not gonna break in a year or so), ideally can handle up to 22kg, reversible seat, suspension on wheels with front wheel lock. i know it's a lot on my wishlist. went through 20+ reviews on youtube, looked at various stollers at many price points (e.g. Ergobaby, Cybex easy s twist 2, babyzen yoyo, uppababy minu, bugaboo bee 6, nuna trvl, evenflo compact, silver cross jet). and finally decided on this and SOOO HAPPY with this. We initially wanted to go with yoyo2 since it's known to be hard-wearing, long-use , true cabin size but the price deterred me especially when it didn't come with almost lie-flat recline or the foot rest. So after going through many many reviews, baby jogger city tour 2 meets a lot of my wish list (actually everything except the reversible seat) at less than half the price of yoyo2. Yesterday went out with my 5 month old for a stroll in the neighborhood and he loves it. The babyjogger (while it's a compact, city stroller) can take the small bumps on typical Singapore streets, definitely more comfy than my current Doona+ since it has more suspension than that. the legrest is a MUST. The mesh window in the canopy is good for hot weather and to keep an eye on the baby. The canopy is good size but since baby is only 5 months, he's a bit short so the sun does get in his eye. but once he grows taller, it'll get better. It's barely 1 inch wider than the Doona so hope i can zip around malls and narrow restaurants. The fold is not easy with one hand especially when it's new and the mechanism is still stiff and i got wrist pain (typical mum's wrist problem) and the 2 buttons needs to be pressed/pushed simultaneously but at this price and full of features, it's a win!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612efHYILFL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613wvwqYBJL._SY1600.jpg",,TRUE,,4,,
11/14/2021,Singapore,4,Amazon Customer,Great travel stroller,Love almost everything about the baby jogger - it glides smoothly on flat ground providing a comfortable ride for the child and easy manoeuvring for parents. The space is wide and long enough and the calf support is great. My toddler and 3month old baby took turns to ride on it and were able to sleep soundly and comfortably in it. The one hand folding requires some getting used to and is not as easy as they show it on video but unfolding it is a breeze. I did not like that it does not stand on it's own while folded - resulted in my baby jogger getting some scratches when it hits the floor.,,,TRUE,,3,B07NZPT3TR,Style: City Tour 2 Stroller | Color: Pitch Black

01/09/2021,Mexico,5,Fernanda,PERFECTA!!,"La mejor carriola del mundo!!! Estoy super satisfecha con la compra, la usamos por primera vez en un viaje a USA a Disney, es muy practica comoda ligera y super facil de abrir y cerrar. No tuve problema para llevarla en el carry on del avion incluso en una ocasión la quisieron documentar por pensar que no cabia y les demostre lo compacta que era. Mi bebe super comoda, el espacio de la canastilla es bueno lo unico es que el canopy no cubre tanto pero nada que un accesorio no pueda solucionar! Ademas de todo lo mencionado es nomita y estetica no como otras carriolas de viaje. Plus se ve de muy buena calidad y resistente. Gira super bien, de muy buena suspencion y rodado! Simplemente perfecta.",,,TRUE,,2,B07NZPT3TR,Style: City Tour 2 Stroller | Color: Pitch Black

12/20/2019,Singapore,4,Yunen,Good compact stroller with some design flaws,"I hate that it can't self stand after folding, and that the belly/bumper bar has to be purchased separately. Also, I have a tendency to pick it up via the handlebar after it's folded, causing the stroller to open up and hit my leg.But other than that, it's really a sturdy stroller with a smooth ride, flat recline and compact folding.",,,TRUE,,4,,
