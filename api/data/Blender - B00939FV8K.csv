I decided to invest in a good blender since I have already gone through 3 (which added up to the cost of this Ninja blender).

The only con I'd say is that it is not the most discreet, however, it is less noisy than your average blender. This blender also acts as a food processor and honestly one of my favorite features.

04/12/2023,United States,1,J. Love,The worst blender ever,"I use a blender everyday. I’ve had many. This is the biggest waste of money for cheap plastic parts and a poorly engineered designed. First, it’s SO loud, which I find ironic given the brand is “ninja.” It’s startling loud, like a second alarm clock, or cold shower in the morning. Second, why does the blade not securely lock into the base? I like all of my breakfast shake, so I turn my blender upside down and let every drop fall into my cup. Since the blade doesn’t lock in, I made a terrible mess, and almost sliced my foot the first time I tried this because the blade just dropped out when I poured my shake out. Third, it takes forever to blend the ice. It does blend the ice, but so has every other blender I’ve owned. This one just takes 3 times as long (and is 4x the price). I make 5 shakes a morning so this has added 5 minutes to my morning routine as it takes about a minute longer for each shake. Finally, why the cheap plastic parts? Again, at 4x the cost of every other blender I’ve owned, I expected high quality materials. My last blender was glass, with a metal base, which was great because it meant it was sturdy, but also easy to clean (in a dishwasher). I was very excited to get this blender as I’ve always wanted a “better” blender (better name brand, professional grade) since I use mine so frequently. Unfortunately, this has not lived up to my expectations at all.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BLPQFOGOW6YJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,0,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

02/18/2023,United States,5,Jerry & Cris,Awesome customer support,"My original pitcher arrived with a funky crack going through the bottom. I looked at returning it, but found I could reach out to the manufacturer for the pitcher to be replaced. 5 minutes on the phone later, and a video call so they could see the crack, and they were sending me a replacement. To top it off the replacement was here a lot faster than they said.The blender is amazing. I have used it with just the shakers and the pitcher. It works like a dream. Making protein shakes with chunks/cubes of ice is not a problem. I pop the shakers, all blades, and shaker lids on the top rack of the dishwasher and they come out fine.

02/11/2023,United States,1,G. Smith,"Cheap plastic, even worse customer service","The black plastic handle disconnected from the plastic pitcher, making the entire unit inoperable because the lid can no longer seal. This happened about after having the unit for 8 months, with limited use. No way to do a warranty claim on website, so called customer service number. Was told wait time would be 10 or 20 minutes, but instead it was 70 min with repetitive “your call is important” recordings just to add a bit of torture for their customers.Reached a helpful agent in the Philippines, but after about 2 min of talking her voice became garbled. This happened 3 times and each time she had to reboot her computer. After explaining it was the pitcher at the beginning of the call and showing the defect on camera, she tells me at the end that “pitchers are not covered under warranty”. Wish she had told me this at the beginning and saved me the additional 30 min of wasted time. With the cheap materials and design of the pitcher and lid, I imagine this is probably what breaks the most, so makes sense financially for them to not cover it, but not so good for their customers.Anyway, I was placed on hold a few more times and offered a “discounted” replacement for $32. I declined as I assume it will break again and I’m really not eager to give Ninja/Shark anymore of my money.

Only problem is the pitcher isn’t very durable. Dropped it once and chipped off one of the corners. No problem, it still worked fine. Now, after having it for a few years, there are small cracks in the pitcher, and it leaks a little bit. Meanwhile, we still have a blender with a glass pitcher that we’ve had since I was a kid (in 40) that still works fine. They don’t make things like they used to, I guess. Replacement pitchers apparently cost more than the entire blender, which…I’m no economist, but I don’t understand how cheap plastic can cost MORE than exactly the same cheap plastic + a powerful blender base.

I returned this first blender and got a replacement but the pitcher on the replacement had almost the same cracks so this got sent back too.

12/11/2022,United States,3,beadr,"Powerful and good, with important caveats","We have enjoyed our Ninja with a couple of caveats: Blades aren't low enough to blend smaller amounts, although this model comes with single service options. Not enough speeds- even on 1 (of 3) when you open the spout to add as you mix, liquid flies out. Very Loud. Too many safety features- pegs that push in and tabs that snap and lock, all of these are failing after only 4 years, so now my blender is stuck shut and I have to smack, punch, yank, pull to get it open every time. Unless it just opens as it should, which it does sometimes. Also, you cannot get a new carafe and lid except for about $10 cheaper than the new one. Used is an option, but be careful, they made a few different designs of base to carafe connection and they don't fit together if you don't get just the right model number.

I said you have got to be kidding me and was then quickly offered a 50% discount. I said not acceptable and after a brief hold was told they would send the replacement part for free. Just plain silly....wasting 45 minutes of my time.

I've only had it for a day and it's the second blender I've ever owned in my adult life so do with my review what you will. The first one was some glass kind from Target that was really cheap but that thing lasted for ten years. This Ninja was purchased because my toddler is in love with smoothies. There are two things that I don't like about this so far, but not deal breakers: 1. We aren't too excited about a plastic canister but at the same time, it's probably better with a kid who likes to visit all of our appliances every day and 2. It is a very tall appliance, but we have a lot of space between our counters and cabinets thank goodness. That being said, it was easy to figure out right out of the box and it was very easy to clean afterwards. Turning on the power button and selecting a blend feature this morning scared the you know what out of me and my toddler. We weren't prepared for the type of power this thing puts out. If you haven't had your morning coffee yet and need to wake up, this'll do.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LU0VKWCXXK45/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,16,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

08/08/2022,United States,3,Elizabeth,Pitcher blade wrong choice for smoothies,"Product is not designed for smoothies made with ice. The blade on the pitcher does not have a cyclonic blade (a blade that makes a cyclone and a vortex to do its work) and leaves ice in granular condition. This is intentional, as it is designed for other jobs. The small 16 oz. cups that come with this are equipped with a cyclonic blade and will make smooth smoothies - no grains. I have to blend 32 ounces in the pitcher and then use the 16 ounce one to get rid of the granularity. Once I figured this problem out - thanks to some serious blender experts on reviews - I tested it, and there is no doubt. You can blend forever in the pitcher, but the ice will be grainy, and you can literally see the grains on a straw or even on the side of the pitcher.

Individual cups are great—I haven’t used the large chamber yet, the cups are too convenient. I make a fruit smoothie every morning now before my bike ride to work, it’s super quick and easy—entire cup blends in about 5 seconds. There is some twisting in the plastic which keeps powders, seeds, and fruit from getting stuck in the corners—genius. The super sharp blade is easy to (carefully) clean off in the sink right after use. Cups, tops, and blade are all fine in my high-heat dishwasher. I usually use silicone straws, but I have a large (smoothie style) steel straw which DOES fit into the cup-top opening! Super convenient if my partner needs to take it in the car to work. Not completely spill-proof but about 90%. The suction cups on the bottom of the blender base are a great addition, keeps it from sliding around on the counter.

The smoothie cups it comes with are too small & it’s not universal at all so I can’t just buy bigger cups, to my knowledge, I tried to buy some & they didn’t fit the single serve blade. The bottom piece on the pitcher looks like it’s also coming unglued I guess you would say. Also don’t come for me for my sink, I’m doing the dishes now 🤣Idk I’m just overall disappointed because I know the cost is high but the product is cheap. I will say it’s easy to use though I guess.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lfMxzL4EL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Eyyw01XHL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71t5TlJkdnL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Hsb5THZAL._SY1600.jpg",,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15Y8Y3L8PFPEF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,0,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

04/13/2022,United States,1,T Arthur,cheaply built food processor - not good for smoothies - why are these so popular?,"I replaced a 2 year old kitchenmaid blender with this one - I use a blender for one purpose - to make a smoothie most weekday mornings. After 6 months I'm giving up and junking it. But really, this unit was never suitable for what I bought it for - so getting rid of it is overdue.The positives: It's relatively quiet, and the unique blade design draws food into the large pitcher without tamping.The negatives:- The blade design creates a vortex that really makes this more of a food processor than a blender. If you want to make a puree for soup, it's great. If you like your smoothies very grainy and chewy, then it's fine. To get one even remotely smooth I had to blend for about 3 minutes, and even then nuts, for example, are still very grainy- cleanup - also due to the blade design, there's no self-clean feature, so you have to put the pitcher and parts in the dishwasher. However, despite manufacturer claims, it's not dishwasher safe and starts to leak all over the base and the counter after two weeks. This happened with two different pitchers, so it's not a fluke. If you choose to buy one anyway, they will try to sell you the replacement pitcher for $80, but if you refuse to pay they will eventually give it to you - but it will still fail in two weeks. I kept using mine and cleaning up after it, and after 3 months the pitcher just cracked.- The cup (with more traditional blade) actually works reasonably well for making a smoothie - however, I found 16 ounces to be too small to be useful. (Note that they have apparently corrected this in the newer model by increasing the smoothie cup to 24 ounces, so if you must have a ninja, then definitely go with the newer model). You can't get a larger replacement cup for this base - I tried.- Aside from making grainy smoothies and falling apart quickly, as others have noted the blade is hazardous if you aren't careful, so please be careful if you do buy one.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G8THN63SB2VC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,15,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

03/20/2022,United States,5,SB,Love the individual blending cups,"We chose this model because it included the individual blending cups, but I was concerned because some reviewers said the cups were too small. The 16oz cups are the perfect size for our smoothies and they make clean-up incredibly easy. I initially thought I’d use a cup if I was just making a smoothie for one person and I’d use the larger pitcher for two or more people, but now I realize making even two or more smoothies in the cups is better - I can make each smoothie to each child’s particular preference, the blade in the cup is incredibly effective, and I prefer the ease of rinsing off the cup blade to cleaning out the whole pitcher and the larger s-blades.Another surprise benefit is the blending power. I use chia seeds in our smoothies and I love that the little cup blade is able to pulverize them - no more weird chia seed texture and no more whole chia seeds stuck in our teeth.As much as I love the 16oz cups, I’m glad we have the larger pitcher too. I do a lot of baking and like to use the pitcher for blending ingredients.

03/15/2022,United States,1,Shervin,Ring Develops Toxic Mold | No Replacement Available,"These problems have developed after a short period of occasional use and immediate washing and drying after each use.(1) The flawed design of the blade unit features a cavity that houses a ring to provide a seal. You wouldn't know it exists unless you look for it. The manual doesn't mention the need for it to be taken out for cleaning either. In no time, it develops toxic mold that deeply penetrates the material, impossible to clean or remove with any method. They offer no replacement for this ring and you are forced to buy the entire base unit of the blade that costs a 1/3 of the unit no including the shipping. Third party rings do not fit this item. So essentially it is a disposable garbage.(2) The base unit itself, shown here develops many visible marks and dents after a short period of use. It means that probably lots of microplastics end up in the blend. All of Ninja's other models have this problem as well, which is why I moved to Braun.(3) Also the dark coloration of the base means that if mold is growing on the plastic, it will simply not be visible to the naked eye.In spite of the aggressive marketing of Ninja as a top notch brand, it's performance, design and longevity record leaves much to be desired.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+S6zsaQKL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71T8zDGyuwL._SY1600.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xdPp7-vFL._SY1600.jpg",,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KG45RMSLP8PI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,2,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

03/11/2022,United States,2,doug,Did not work for my smoothie use!,I’m giving it two stars because it did at least work. When I did my homework on the two most important things a blender should have according to the professional experts is a square bottom and fix blades in the bottom that don’t come out just like every professional blender out there. So I was already skeptical at the very large center post with cutters in this mixer but yet everyone had high reviews of it. My first problem came when it didn’t have enough power or the cutting blades in the right place to cut up the solids in my smoothie like almonds and flaxseeds. The second problem is the giant post with the cutters in the center took up far too much room inside the picture making it a much smaller size picture than normal. The third problem came with every time you clean it out if you forget to grab that post with the cutters it falls out landing in the sink and potentially breaking the cutters or worse yet cutting you picking it back up to deal with it . So in my opinion for my needs this Mixer was far under powered and incorrectly designed for the use of making smoothies where is solids are involved like nuts and seeds.

03/09/2022,United States,1,V. Silva,Stay away from this blender,"This blender has many critical flaws that you should consider before buying.First, the threads in the cups are proprietary. Better blenders will allow you to use just about any mason jar for blending which is really convenient to reduce clean up time and waste.Second, the blades are a death trap. This blender has so many annoying safety features like it will only power on when locked in one position with the lid on (which makes it terrible for some soups since you can’t push the contents down), but at the same time every person that tries to clean the blades ends up cutting themselves. Seriously flawed and unsafe design.Third, the lip on the lid required two hand operation, it will not stay open when pouring without tilting it back.Lastly, the cup is way too narrow. In an effort to make this blender incompatible with standard mason jars they made the smoothie cups way too narrow, making them impossible to clean with just a sponge.Basically this is an average blender, with proprietary features that make it worse than a standard blender.

If you put those in your smoothies, you will be swallowing down whole Chia seeds in your smoothie..I blended several times, on very high power for a full minute.

02/25/2022,United States,1,Mary O.,This machine is terrible.,"I have owned several Ninja blenders. I loved Ninja. I have bought many Ninja blenders for friends. Probably more than 10. But this is the first time I have been very displeased with what I bought. This machine does not crush ice. I found that out after reading the enclosed manual. I would not have bought it if it had mentioned that on-line. EVERYTHING has to be pulsed. You cannot set it to stay on unless you hold your finger on the button. Supposedly it has 3 speeds. I can't see any differences. It has a pulse button, but what good is it? You must turn the machine off. Every other Ninja turns off after about 5 minutes. This has less features than a $50 ordinary blender. It had the outrageous price of $120.

02/23/2022,United States,3,Lauren Preston,On the fence about this blender,"Before placing the order w/Amazon, I 'google' searched for the 'best' blenders. This Ninja BL660 model was highly rated, so I ordered it because my last blender (purchased from Costco), which was maybe 3 years broke a week prior. You're supposed to push the button on the top and that releases it from the base. Well that stopped working, which is why I had to get a new one. My new blender was delivered the next day (love that Amazon feature). When I pulled it out the box, I realized it was the exact blender that just broke on me. Had I paid better attention, I would not have purchased the exact same blender because I anticipate having the same issue in 3 more years. The blender was only $100, so I guess spending $33.33 per year to blend smoothies isn't too bad. I also don't care for the plastic container - would definitely prefer glass.

02/11/2022,United States,5,Tracie_Renee,Best Blender I've had yet...,"My last blender was a Kitchen Aide 5-Speed 600 watt Diamond Blender. It lasted a fair amount of years before it recently started having motor issues. I was disappointed in it which is why I went a second round with Ninja. My first Ninja was a motor-on-top blender and it was okay, but that particular model wasn't a fit for me. Enter the Ninja BL660 Professional Countertop Blender with 1100-Watt Base, and 72 oz pitcher. There is nothing I don't like about this blender. It's quiet. My KA was so loud that you couldn't have a conversation even on the lowest speed. And speaking of speed...the 1100 watts means that my frozen fruit morning smoothies are being blended on low speed in less time and with more consistency than any blender I've ever used. I make 48 ounces of smoothie five days a week, 48 weeks a year. I've only had this blender for just over two weeks, so I'm not going to be able to speak to longevity at this point, but I will update my review when I can. My KA was what I call blade on the bottom technology. Due to that and it's lower wattage, my old KA used to have a massive air bubble in the smoothy that made it difficult and time consuming to deal with on a constant basis. The Ninja spindle blade is better technology, in my opinion. Having blades up and down on a spindle means that the blending is happening in the entire pitcher and not just on the bottom. This results in way better consistency every time. And less time spent blending, which should translate to longevity if I'm not abusing it to make it do what I need it to do. The base is lite. My KA weight in a whopping 12 pounds and I dropped it once because it was heavy for a one-handed pick up. I love the fact that it has suction cups on the bottom of the base. Although I did have to put a towel under it for storage so those suction cups didn't stick to where I had it stored...the stability of having it stuck onto the counter is priceless. And that lid! Fully locking, including the pour spout. My KA had a rubber lid and over time it stopped being tight to stay on without me holding it. My blender pitcher, lid and blade will only ever be hand-washed. I know what the manufacturer says, but dishwashers do to dishes what dryers do to clothes. To potentially increase the longevity of this blender I'm not using the dishwasher. I was super excited to get the the two individual 16 ounce cups. While these will not be used for smoothies because a single smoothie is 24 ounces a piece....these will be perfect for mixed drinks, or a simple crushed fruit smoothy snack. I'm so pleased with this purchase and I'm hoping this lasts a while.",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1U3L4Y1WIWB8Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,0,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

12/08/2021,United States,2,Jose Figueroa,Misleading Reviews - Difficult/Dangerous to Clean (Avoid),"I hardly ever write reviews, but I would definitely encourage you to avoid this product. The blades are extremely difficult to clean after use without dishwashing machine. There are many grooves in the housing of the blade and the actual container portion. The blades are very sharp, so if you make an attempt to clean it by hand... you will get sliced. The cups that come with them are pretty small and also difficult to clean by hand since they are small. You will need a brush to get the inside. If you use a dishwashing machine, then sure, this blender will do the job just fine though the container is pretty large to fit in standard dish washing machines.I would just avoid altogether, personally. I know the 4.8 star rating (at the time of this review) is tempting, but just be cautious when cleaning by hand if you do get it.

Every time I use it- sheer joy realizing how simple this makes my tasks. It cleans like a dream too. And Chefie tip- you can also blend warm water and a small shot of dish liquid for cleaning it on the spot.

Luckily I was in the kitchen when it happened and immediately stopped the blender.I called the warranty dept to have it replaced under the 1yr warranty and have still yet to be addressed and treated as a decent customer. I rarely post reviews but the BEYOND TERRIBLE Customer Service from the claims dept, warranty dept, escalation dept has motivated me to share my experience. It’s been 4 days of complete run around from the teams at Shark / Ninja. I initially spoke to Ian, & I completed a video call with Ian to verify the blenders malfunction. He promised the claims dept would call me the following day, which someone named Nicole from Escalations did call at 9:15am and left a call back number for me. I returned the call at 9:25am and have been continuing to call everyday to speak with Nicole. No one has followed up with me for days, not even an email to provide a status update. Every time I call I get the same response, “ the escalations team will call you in 2-4 hours”. I even had specific warranty reps state they have spoken to Nicole and she promises to call back in 2-4hrs (which is a ridiculous time frame)… no one ever calls..Over the past 4 days I have spoken to a number of reps from Ninja including Mitsey, Tiffany, Camille, Daniel 3x, Shanice, Christopher and Manager Alejandro who promised to resolve the issue and have Nicole from Escalations reach out to me today at 9am… you take a guess if I received a call…I am beyond frustrated with Ninja & their associates.

10/25/2021,United States,1,Amazon Customer,Smoke in the kitchen,"This review is written 1 year and 2 weeks after I purchased the Ninja blender.A few days ago while making a smoothie (water, soft fruits and 3 cubes of ice) the unit started to release a strong smell. While I approached it, suddenly thick smoke started to be released from the Ninja Blender and filled the kitchen with this smoke having a very strong smell. I immediately unplagued the unit from the power electricity outlet.As a good customer and as a concern for the safety of future customers, I have called the customer service and told them about it. I proposed to send them the unit so that they could inspect it to prevent any danger that can occur to their customers in the future. I was told they don't do that because of COVID-19.Since all this occurred only 2 weeks after the warranty expired, I was told that I need to pay full price to get a new one, when I insisted that this does not make sense I was offered to pay 50% and refused. Indeed, they don't have to since a year passed but due to the unusual safety circumstances I was expecting more from a company as big as Ninja.My review here is not due to frustration of not getting a new unit, I will buy one from a different brand anyway, It is just to make sure that before you buy this blender you are aware of what happened to me.So - if you are planning to buy this blender, take into consideration my story and make sure to check if you have smoke or strong smell from your unit.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXAP5YYXRM4U7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,10,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

10/14/2021,United States,3,Marcia,Does not blend smoothies as well as bullet. Single serve cups are too small and poorly designed.,"I thought this was going to replace my bullet, but it doesn't. It is convenient for making a big batch of smoothies, but it doesn't blend as well as the bullet. Oatmeal, blueberries and seeds in the smoothie remain a bit gritty. The single size cups are only 16oz which means the fill line is below that -- way too small for a decent size smoothie. The single serve also can only be pulsed, so you have to hold the button on the entire time. That's a lot of holding if you use frozen fruit. The blade top threads/screws on to the outside of the cup, while the sip top screws on to the inside of the cup. So there is always smoothie you have to wipe off from the outside threads. There are no larger aftermarket single serve cups for this model ... only 16 oz.

Even my customer service experience was commendable in many ways. Their ability to create a video call led to a faster resolution. But that is the root of the problem. There was no resolution. The suction cup feet are literally the achilles heel. Why? Because they are not replaceable, making your blender less stable and less safe.

It took ours out of commission (see photos), and a replacement pitcher is only slightly cheaper than an entirely new blender. The forums and reviews have DOZENS of reports of this happening. Also, the crappy pitcher design prevents water from draining out of the four little corner pockets when you wash it upside-down in a dishwasher, so the goop that accumulates in them is DISGUSTING, and darn near impossible to clean out because of the size and shape (see photo).A pity, since we LOVED the blending - efficient and powerful.

09/06/2021,United States,1,Kenneth H. Beckett,EXTREME safety hazard! YOU WILL BLEED.,"Tried to pick up the blade pillar to clean it, and it sliced one of my fingers open. So, with extremely light pressure, tried again - and sliced another finger on the other hand. From the reviews, I see this is a common problem. The blade assembly is very heavy, and the top is tapered and slippery when wet, but if you try to pick it up between the blades and you touch one, you will bleed. The blades are insanely sharp - pretty much zero pressure is required to cut you to the bone! They will pass through your flesh like it's made of warm butter. I very much doubt it's necessary for these blades to be so sharp to do their job when spinning at high speed - I use and handle other blenders all the time, and touch the blades, and have never been cut by one (and I've been doing this almost 50 years). I didn't even use the blender myself - I was just trying to clean it for my wife after she chopped some nuts and it left residue on the blades. I probably saved her from being sliced open, but I've told her I will never touch this blender-from-hell again. Yes, there was a warning about the blades being sharp, but it was definitely not firm enough. It should say that it's almost impossible for your finger to touch a blade without being instantly sliced open. The cuts aren't small, either - about 1/2 long and very deep. I think both times it wasn't the end of the long curving blades that got me, but where they have a little elbow right where they protrude from the shaft - they are super-thin and super-sharp there.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CLZBVFCMQ6YP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,13,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

My original ones had a flip away snap to close the opening. (see me making a mess somewhere in the future) 2. The plastic used for the blending pitcher is flimsy compared to my original one. 3.

08/27/2021,United States,1,P. J.,Most overrated blender on market,"Have owned this blender for several years now and am consistently disappointed by its performance at almost every use. The large blender unit in spite of its formidable looking multi-blade is very poor at mixing and can hardly crush normal sized ice cubes which spin and skitter around inside for many minutes without being crushed. Not good, in other words, for ice based smoothies. The noise is also horrendous and deafening. Frankly, it puts out so many decibels that it should come with a warning to wear hearing protection, especially given how long you have to run it to get a smoothie.The smaller single cup units actually work better than the big one (they are geared to spin faster) but are not without problems: they tend to cavitate easily and then the small blade just spins in a pocket of air and does nothing. Also the gasket (O-ring) that seals it gets moldy and stinks after a few weeks of use because food gets behind or under it. After a few more weeks, if not cleaned, the mold begins to turn the light colored rubber gasket black and it has to be thrown away. Getting it out to clean it is an incredible pain. We use a dental pick, but it occasionally cuts or perforates the O-ring decreasing its life span further. There are blenders one third of the price that function as well as this one.

08/02/2021,United States,1,snowdrop,I hate this blender so expletive much,"I use a vitamix at home, but my sister had purchased this for my mother to replace an old blender from circa 1996. This has been such a disappointment for the price point. I’ve used it 3x and I am ready to light it on fire and bring my small several years old vitamix to my mom’s to replace it.The first time I used it, I made a green sauce and was a little irritated that it didn’t blend greens smoothly. The second time, I tried to blend rolled oats into oat flour and after several minutes of blending at various speeds there were still chunks of oats in it. The third time, I made a cashew-based dip using cashews I had boiled for about 20+ minutes to ensure they were nice and soft because I didn’t trust this blender; after blending for 20 or more minutes, my sauce was still slightly grainy with visible tiny chunks of whole spices and I finally gave up… this is a sauce that takes me 1-3 minutes in my vitamix and should have whipped up like whipped cream. Given how much time I had to blend this for in the ninja to get mediocre results, I’m pretty done with trying to use this and think I’ll just try my luck with the food processor next time instead.Additionally, it’s annoying to get onto the base and even more annoying to clean. With my vitamix, I just rinse it out, throw a few drops of soap into the container and fill it about 1/3 full with water, run it on high for a minute, and then rinse off the parts and it’s clean. This blender gets sauce caked on to the middle of the base just below where it attaches that doesn’t come off with rinsing or blending and requires manual scrubbing. It’s also quite loud, which I wouldn’t have an issue with if it didn’t take so many minutes for it to barely accomplish the most basic blending functions.I cannot reiterate how useless this blender is. If you’re doing any sort of blending beyond something simple like smoothies (which I could still have accomplished with my mom’s 25 year old sunbeam), run away from this.",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REJQ6192GJ93H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,0,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

For being on the pricier side it is not durable at all. The cheap $20 blender I got from Walmart lasted longer and was more durable. Also when I blend eggs I didn’t want to use the big blender and I would use the individual size and the eggs or anything that was somewhat liquidy would leak out all over the place.

06/11/2021,United States,3,Art,I have used better,"I have used a few times now to get a feel of the product. I had a vitimax and it died on me the second use but the first use it was excellent. So in comparison to that first use of the vitimax I would give it 5 out of 10. The three blades are not a bad feature but they don’t chop up the ice or suck it down from the top to get blended. Additionally it does not blend to the point where your smoothie is smooth like the vitimax, you still get some bits of ice.The challenge to this unit is cleaning. The blades are not easy to clean. I have cut my fingers three times now and since the blades are sharp the cuts are long and deep, which take days to heal. So you have to be very very careful when cleaning the blades. Because I use peanut butter and other similar products the blades need a wash cloth to clean not just a rinse.I’m going to keep and continue using because at least it works! Maybe I had a bad Vitimax but that blender for the first use was excellent.

05/19/2021,United States,1,Humiliated Grapes,Ninja blenders/customer service are awful!,"First, I should note how I use blenders. I use one every single day to make smoothie bowls or shakes for breakfast and sometimes for sauces and blended soups ... and the occasional frozen cocktail. I'm gentle with my appliances and never put anything in a blender that would cause it to work too hard. The only solid things I ever put in it are frozen fruits (always in small chunks), and occasionally some ice - pre-crushed by my refrigerator's ice dispenser - and always with adequate liquids to keep things moving smoothly.Now that you know my typical use, I can explain why I will never purchase another Ninja product again. This is the second Ninja blender I've wasted my money on in the span of two years. The first one (a different model) broke between the base and the blade assembly. The motor ran, and the drive stud would spin, but the blades didn't. That happened within 9 months of using it. I returned that to Costco (and got a refund, thank God) and did my research and, against my own better judgment, bought this one. After LESS than a year of use, this one also broke. One day it just decided it randomly didn't want to spin anymore. I'd push the buttons and all I'd hear is a click - no motor spinning. This would happen intermittently, but more often than not. I contacted Customer Service at Ninja and told them about the issue. They had me video chat with them and show them what was going on. Of course, during the chat, it worked fine. They offered to send me a new blade assembly. I told them I didn't think that would fix the problem, but they said it would be the first step in fixing the issue and sent it to me anyway. Ok, fine. When the new assembly showed up, I attached it and, sure enough, the blender still didn't work. Surprise, surprise! (giant eyeroll). By this time, the blender had completely stopped working. I called to tell them it still was not working and video chatted again, this time showing the clicking/not spinning. I said I thought the problem was most likely an issue with the base and asked if they could send me a replacement. Because they sent the assembly to me for free, they told me that sending a new base would require me to pay the shipping price of $20. Ummm.... that's 1/4 the price of a whole new blender!! AND IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. Because of my first experience with a Ninja blender, I purchased the Amazon extended warranty when I bought this one. Sadly, because I reported this issue while the blender was still under Ninja's warranty, Amazon's warranty would not cover the defect. Live and learn, people. Live and learn.Needless to say, I stopped purchasing these cheap garbage blenders from Ninja and splurged on a Vitamix instead. Don't waste your money on Ninja crap, folks. Save up and get a blender that lasts more than a few months and from a company that offers a warranty with no out-of-pocket costs.Side note: I never once used the blender carafe - only the two individual serving cups that the blender came with. When I pulled the carafe out of my cabinet to donate to GoodWill because it had never been used, I noticed it was cracked at the bottom where the blade assembly is, so it probably would have leaked if I'd used it. It still had the tape on it from shipping, it was still brand new, but it was cracked. Horrible, horrible QA at Ninja. So that went into the trash, too. Look at photos from other reviews and you'll see that cracked carafes are a recurring issue.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ASLPIJAI2AQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,29,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

It’s powerful and easy to clean.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UGTPA51MN6DI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,0,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,
05/19/2021,United States,5,Amy Simmonds,High Quality Blender at a Reasonable Price!,"I was looking for a blender that could really crush things for both ice and making vegan cheeses. For cheese, you really need a powerful blender because the consistency is similar to melted mozzarella. When you're talking 8+ ounces of cheese, you can easily burn up a standard blender trying to mix the binding agents into the recipe. A Vitamix is obviously a top-tier choice for all that stuff, but if you're not willing to shell out double, triple, or even quadruple this price, you can bet on a Ninja.My second favorite part about this is that it's versatile. The blade easily comes out so I can thoroughly rinse and scrub it without having to reach into a blender cup and put pressure onto the bottom (maybe why the bottoms are cracking for some people)? The fact that these little blender cups sit right where the big one goes is a genius feature because it's easy to have a million and one little kitchen gadgets to clean and store, and having your smoothie blender work on the same device trims it down one more.You can save yourself one more device if you can get away with using it as your food processor. It's nice to be able to use the little cups and put them in my dishwasher rather than taking up a huge amount of space the food processor does in there.If I had to give this a gripe, it would be the overall shape of the blender pitcher. Square obviously isn't ideal since the blending motion is happening in a circle, so if you're like me and like to put water in the blender and run it before putting it in the dishwasher, you might have to take an extra step to hit the corners.The other part is that, as others have mentioned, the lid is a little tricky for some. It's actually a safety feature that triggers a sensor so it will not run without the lid in place. The lid goes on a certain way and it's easy to forget if you're not using it frequently. You will not have a leak if you're aligning the lid correctly and not forcing the lid on in another direction. This is also a powerful blender, so even if you're running a small amount of stuff through here, it may very well splash up to the bottom of the lid if you're running it on full blast.If money were no object, I might get myself a $500+ blender, but if it's like anything much higher than the mainstream, I'll really need to try it myself before I can justify that much additional value. This is a great buy for a reasonable consumer wanting an upgraded blender, and it has served me well for the hard work I've had it do! I'm rating this 4 stars because I'm sure there's a high-end model out there that is quiet, blasts through ice, and is even easier to clean, but for this price point, this is the best out there.",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NNH4MQUZSGU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,0,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

05/07/2021,United States,1,Josh Taylor,Pure Trash,"This goes for all Ninja Blenders. They are very cheaply made. The plastic is easily shattered or parts will break off. Not only that but to clean it, the blade part is on loosely, so you have to do this slow pull from the top to not cut a finger. Very annoying to clean them. Also, putting it away means gently grabbing this.Now, my favorite gripe,the lids are dumb. The locking is okay but the pour spout always breaks off. In a month or within the year, after using it, little plastic holding it in place will crack. Then they want you to buy a new lid/blender. Ridiculous. If the blades were locked in, not a huge deal but if you pour without the lid, out comes the three blade tower. Bit of a mess then.Overall I cannot recommend this. Just buy a regular blender. I know, not as I intricate or elaborate, but with the name brand like this, they are selling a poor product. Buying the name is far from you get. At least a good blender can last 20 years. This you can expect a couple of years. For the price, not acceptible.Hard to clean, poor engineering, forgot to mention, very loud, and cheap.

04/21/2021,United States,3,RJK,Defeated Ninja! :(,So I bought this so that we could make smoothies and stews and other things at home.Pros:- I like that it can fit a large volume (72oz) and that it can crush ice but used it only once this way and was afraid it would break.- It comes with 2 x 16 oz cups as well which is nice.Cons:- It is very loud- it deformed in the dishwasher and now we can’t close the lid anymore!! So this product is advertising falsely and they say it is dishwasher safe when it is not! You can see in my pictures how the top of the ninja deformed and now I can’t close the lid- the 16 oz cups don’t come with a lid that completely closes on the top but has an opening to drink from but if you are traveling by car or on public transportation then it makes it very easy for there to be spills.- ExpensiveOverall:I do not recommend buying this expensive product.

The cups are the perfect size for personal smoothies and smaller blends. The 72 oz is a bit big for me, I might try the smaller 52 oz, because the only downside is, if the 72 oz container is not about half full, it does not blend quite as well and you need to scrape the sides a few times to get everything even.

02/18/2021,United States,1,Air KoryO,"If I could give this piece of crap zero stars, I would","Scratch that, it deserves NEGATIVE STARS.By far, this piece of crap is the absolute worst home appliance I have ever owned. You have the whirling blades of death, with the stupid locking mechanism at the bottom that does a great job of getting peanut butter, smoothies, or whatever else you just made deep inside it. This makes it difficult to clean without running it through the dishwasher about three times (minimum).Then, if you don't get the lid precisely on top of the center of the blade mechanism, it won't lock. The stupid thing won't run if you can't lock it, obviously. Any time you want to use this ridiculously overhyped nightmare you are stuck fiddling with it for 10 minutes, just for 30 seconds of blending action.But wait, there's MORE!The stupid lid apparently is prone to break. I did not know this when I bought this wretched excuse of an appliance, and if I had, I would have kept looking. There are YouTube videos about how to fix the mother flipping lid, I kid you not, and it looks like if you don't get the repair precisely right (of course....), you're screwed. Shocking, I know.No, I didn't try fixing it myself. I was afraid of what evil kind of Easter egg Satan's assistant at the factory put in there. I'm just happy this (appliance) garage queen has not sliced my hand open, or injured any of my family members. (Being left with glop instead of a blueberry banana smoothie, in exchange for not having to go to the ER because of a laceration? I'll take it and be grateful. It could be so, so much worse.)Do yourself a favor and get anything but this blender. I don't care if it has an alleged lifetime warranty. All that means is....if it breaks, you get ANOTHER one of these horrible, terrible, no good pieces of crap (after forking over another $14.95, naturally, because I'm sure the sadists who invented this have a relative in their customer abuse department.)If 2020 had an official blender, it would be this wretched pile of plastic and inferior design. It's only suitable for masochists who enjoy taking way too long to make their quick breakfasts. The Ninja is the perfect gift for people you absolutely, totally despise (like an ex, a boss from hell, the teacher who made your life miserable for a year way back when, or your in-laws.)

02/15/2021,United States,3,REalHousewife,Best thing about this is the add-on single Spend a little more and get entry level vitamix instead,"I hmmed and hawed about buying this. I'd had a Ninja blender before that I had won on a talk show of all things. Since it was free, I didn't complain. I even cut my thumb on the blade once while cleaning it, which required 5 stitches. But I chalked that up to being my own fault, however, I vowed never again to buy a Ninja blender. Well, after 4-5 years, the motor gave out and I was back looking for a blender.I ended up purchasing Ninja again because a. Vitamix was triple the price and b. I had some Amazon gift cards to use towards it. I thought the blender may have improved over the years and I liked that it had the one-serve attachment.Well, I am almost 6 months in and I regret this purchase. It has the same wicked blade attachment and same awkward installation. The same method of chopping- not really blending- so it ends up being somewhat of a coarse mixture when blending anything that had any sort of texture to begin with. Even strawberries stay lumpy. I hate how you must remove that wicked dangerous blade with your fingers!! and if I find I need to blend more, which I almost always do with this blender, I have to pour it all out into another container, rinse, and start over in order to re-insert the dad-blamed blade apparatus.The lid is crazy-making. It only works when on a certain way, with the pin, I get it, safety, but when storing this monstrosity, it never wants to close when on the vessel, so you are left to store each component separately: a. a huge, heavy platform with a cord that has no way to wind neatly, b. that deadly blade, c. a cover with a flap open and won't go back on top of the vessel. This results in the 5-inch deadly blade rattling around in some cabinet ready to fall out and slice anyone unfortunate enough to be within striking distance.To say I hate this blender with a passion is an understatement. It doesn't even blend well. Forget about smooth sauces and purees. Ain't gonna happen. And it didn't even come with a chopper attachment- I have a separate mini Cuisinart for that. So a cabinet full of half-useful, dangerous, and heavy/awkward appliances- I still have my old Oster and I'm really thinking of chucking this for that one- it actually made blended smoothies far better than this Ninja.If you are considering this, keep looking.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX52DSCVYRK19/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,7,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

The large container is VERY large (and a bit cumbersome to store) so I didn't really have a need for it but liked that I could blend up individual things in the smaller containers. We have 4 people in our household with very different likes so the individual containers were really nice. We used it a fair amount but not heavily for the first couple of months, then slowly tapered off use until recently. (Dec 2020) I made morning smoothies, plugged it in, tried to blend and it is completely dead. I tried different plugs in the kitchen, tried unplugging and plugging back in.

11/26/2020,United States,3,Don Cristobel,"Maybe too powerful, definitely too small of a pour-in opening","I have had a protein smoothie for lunch at least 300 days a year for at least the last 15 years. My blender finally died and I had to replace it, and I bought this.When a blender is too powerful it can introduce almost too much air into the smoothie and then you eat it and it is all fluffed up and you end up getting really bloated trying to get it all down. It just is not good. There are only 3 speeds, I wish there was more control. This will definitely destroy whatever you put in it.I really dislike the lid. The spout to add stuff to it while spinning (like my whey powder) is in the corner, not in the middle, so anything you pour in tends to get stuck on the side of the jug. Also its too small, too small for my standard whey scoop. I don't use weird whey, I use the best selling nationwide brand. The little spout is just too small. The whey doesn't get mixed great if I don't add it while the liquid is in motion.This is super easy to clean, the jug is all 1 piece. The blade sits on a gear, so you can remove the blade and really rinse it or just toss it in the dishwasher. No disassembling the jug.All told, I can probably deal with the power issue by using the lowest setting and making sure I run it as briefly as possible. But the lid...

08/29/2020,United States,4,Shemeka Chargois,Yes it will blend and it is amazing,"was hesitant because this is refurbished but compared to the new options from similar brands, I couldn't justify spending the extra money. Previously, I used a Magic Bullet, which is good but not really adequate for long-term, heavy-duty blending. I used this to make a fruit smoothie with frozen berries and soy milk. I used the smoothie button, which gives a countdown of 60 seconds before turning off. The frozen fruit processed perfectly and there was only a little bit of berry seeds left behind (not even enough to really notice). It was a perfectly smooth texture. No lumps, no chunks of ice, and no clumps of fruit. It got stuck during blending. All it needed was a bit more liquid and it was fine.I like that this blender has the power switch in the back too. The jar is very easy to clean because it's square. I like this design a lot better than other brands because I hate having to take apart the jar to clean it thoroughly. I haven't used the other features on the blender but for a first try, it worked perfectly. For a refurbished unit, there's nothing cosmetically wrong with it. It looks like a brand new model. The jar and lid are brand new but the base is not. I attached pictures of the blade and stopper for the lid.

08/26/2020,United States,3,MotherOfLilDragons3,I Miss My OLD Ninja More,"This was a replacement for old Ninja, that finally died after multiple daily uses, for 7 years. This new one, while it looks the same, most DEFINITELY does NOT perform as well, as my old one. I think they tampered with the motor, and made it different since making these new ones. Now, when I turn it on to mix my protein shake, it starts smoking very easily and quickly, and smells like the motor is burning up. I am not overloading it. Its just ice, almond milk and a scoop of powder. A 1100 watt motor should handle that with ease, but this struggles. I have ZERO doubts, that this product will last more than a year or two. So, sadly, I don't recommend it. I would just save the money, and purchase a Vitamix. It may be more expensive, but in the end, it will last many more years than this puppy. I do like that you get additional cups with this model, as they can be upwards of $20 each. The problem lies in the motor of the base. Also, the little rubber nubs that are down inside the base of this, tend to just pop out for no good reason. I would look down, snd they would be missing. I finally just super glued them back into the base. You can use it without them, but you risk moisture and liquid getting into the internal compartment where the actual motor is. It can also strip the grooves in the blender cups. As a user of this product for over 12 years, I recommend to people, NOT putting the blender cups in the dishwasher. The heat breaks down the plastic, snd causes it split, as well as it will warp the opening of the cups and then the blade attachment will not fit properly, and they will start leaking everywhere when you turn the blender on. If you are only a casual user of this product, this item will be fine for you. However, if you are a heavy user, like myself, where you blend shakes at least 2x a day, every single day, save your $$. It is extremely convenient having the to go cups w/blender attachment. And I have yet to find another blender that can blend to the perfect consistency that i enjoy, which is no slivers of ice, etc. Bottom line, it appears that the actual Ninja company has started cutting corners during the manufacturing of these models, or either has re-outsourced them to someone different and they are made more cheaply on the inside.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN7GB0NOCUP4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,8,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

I mainly used it for smoothies 4-5 times a week and never had an under-blended smoothie - even with ice! In mid-July, I discovered milk leaking out of the bottom of the pitcher. I inspected the bottom and found large cracks around the attachment for the blades. These cracks have rendered the pitcher unusable. The smaller personal cups with the cup blade attachment are still functional, but the pitcher is not. It's a shame that this happened after just barely 6 months of use.

I've used both the single-serving blending cups as well as the large pitcher and both really do a poor job at blending. I specifically bought this smaller scale blender because I pretty much only use the blender to make smoothies, which means I'm not putting ingredients into this thing that are difficult or hard to blend/crush. With this specific model, spinach does not blend completely and cacao nibs stay coarse and mealy in both the single-serving blender and the large pitcher. I am SUPER disappointed.

07/12/2020,United States,2,Consumer,Large container does not blend well due to dumb blade design.,"Just know that the large container with blades on a central stock (aka the original Ninja) does not blend well. If you put kale in your smoothie, you will choke on the kale. The smaller Magic Bullet rip-off containers work well, but the larger container does not make smoothies, it makes chunkies.It's because the developers decided to use perfectly flat blades rather than properly angled blades — like the angled blades helicopters use to go up (or blenders use to blend).I'm convinced it was developed by a sales team:SALES:Let's make a blender with NINJA BLADES that go FYEWW! FYEWW! FYEWW! LIKE THAT!I'M a SALESMAN!Designers:OK here's your prototype.SALES:But why are the blades angled?Designers:Because that's how it has to be if you want the ingredients to blend evenly.SALES:But that's not the BLADE of the NINJA! The NINJA uses FLAT blades!! Make them FLAT like the NINJA! Make them go FYEWW! FYEWW! FYEWW! LIKE THAT! Designers:OOOOOOooookay, here's your stupid non-blending blender...SALES:Yeaaahhhh!

07/12/2020,United States,5,Jon Ball,A powerful and thoughtfully designed blender that gets the job done well.,"I am primarily using this blender to make smoothies, and it does that job well. I like the fact that you can make large quantities with the 9 cup container, which has a three-tiered blade unit that quickly reduces fruit, vegetables, and ice to a drinkable consistency. Just make sure you add some water, which helps fluidize the whole mixture for better mixing and blending. I also like that it comes with two individual tumblers and a blade assembly for the tumblers, so you can make a smaller, individual portion. The tumblers come with sippy caps, so you can take your drink on the go. I find the unit to be easy to use and easy to clean. Simply clean the pieces right away with hot water and soap. Of course, you need to be careful when cleaning the blade assemblies because they are exceptionally sharp. Generally, I just give them a good flush with lots of hot water. I can't tell you much about the durability of the blender; I have only had it for a month, but it appears to be sturdy.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGEP4OQ0URBFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,0,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

Has a button on the lid to lift handle which secures the lid and has a pour spout for a thicker mixture will not pour out over the intended transfer.

05/02/2020,United States,2,Rusnuvol,Not for small jobs,"I was trying to replace a 24 oz smoothie blender because that one became too small. I thought this was the way to go since it was 72oz. I was wrong. It is very noisy, which is fine if it did the job well, but it doesn't blend well. I think you would have to fill it up for the blades to catch everything and blend them, i think. 6 swivel blades are super sharp and can cut you a bit while cleaning, but they don't catch everything in the container.Also this particular model doesn't seem to have a lot of replacement jars. I wanted to get a smaller 32 oz or 48oz jar, but those are very hard to find, for this model only. Ninja Blenders are great, i used one for over 4 years but had to replace it because it was too small which is why i went with this one. But this one is for big jobs it seems It comes with 2, 16oz personal jars, which are nice, but too tiny for me.In conclusion, i would whole-heartedly recommend Ninja blenders, just not this particular model. This comes with a 72oz jar, and it seems it works best for 72oz jobs, nothing smaller. Worse still is that it's hard to find replacement jars that are smaller than 72oz, for this particular model. There are other models that are very similar to this one with the same 72oz jars, but they have 32oz and 48oz jars that are easy to find. The 16oz jars that come with this work very well, but they're too tiny for me.

I had bought a cheap $20 bullet-blender which of course broke so the wife and I shopped around for a blender that would be powerful and have the convenience of using smaller single-serve type containers. The Ninja checked all our boxes.PROS:- Powerful- The single-serve cups are easy to swap and clean.- The removable blade is genius for cleaning and getting out all the goodness.- Locking top is good so you can pour heavy stuff without fear of the top coming off- Build quality seems top notch.CONS:- LOUD. Nice alarm clock for the entire house though.- Suction cups on the bottom are annoying. Rubber pads would've been better- Very tall so it's hard to fit under our kitchen cabinets.- It would be nice to have another (larger) door on the lid to drop in stuff while blending.- The single serve containers could be bigger.- It would be VERY nice if the single-serve containers could blend continuously instead of just pulses.- The main gear on the base is plastic, probably better if metal but thats for the engineers.I know it looks like the CONS outweigh the PROS but they are mostly minor design grips.

03/02/2020,United States,1,Rowan,⚠️ UPDATE! Very impressed! And not disappointed!,"Update 2022: MOLD!! There is mold in the gasket lid where the gasket meets the plastic! I've try soaking in hot water with dish soap and also with bleach and dish water... Nothing has worked! At first I figured I'd just replace it. You can't, YOU HAVE TO BUY THE WHOLE PITCHER costing $64 if they have it in stock... they don't!! I'm so mad!!😠😡 I'll have to buy a new one. I'm going to walmart to buy a cheap blender at a much cheaper price!Update: If you're debating on buying this blender... don't! Just buy it. It cost quite a bit more, since I'm on SSI and had to sacrifice bbut and I'm not at all disappointed or discouraged in this product. It makes full sized ice cubes into snow in about 7sec. I can blend ice cubes frozen fruit, strawberries, raspberries, grapes, bananas, I'm on a slushy/smoothie diet. So I bought a $39 blender that gave out in just 7 days! I had to return it. So I decided to buy one that had a way better reputation. This blender rocks! I didn't have to put in the ingredients one at a time then blend then put in the next. With this blender all I have to do is pile all the ingredients at one time and blend. It did so effortlessly! It crushed the ice, pulverized the frozen fruits, ice cream, almond milk and Greek yogurt.It's a major plus that it came with the go cups and can also be used with the blender.

We don’t even use ice. The positioning of the blades seems to leave flaxseed and Chia seed and hemp seed glued into the corners and not properly mixed. The greens we put in our smoothie aren’t really blended, just sort of chopped The smoothie is never really smooth. It’s always gritty. My last blender was a basic $40 blender and it did a much better job. Also, I can see where the suction cups on the bottom might have been a good idea but they end up being a hassle. You can’t really move the blender back-and-forth on your counter without struggling to get it unstuck.

It's a really powerful blender, but I don't know yet, what was wrong with my blender. I wanted to make a benana smoothie. I added banana, milk, honey and vanilla Ice cream and let it to run. I went the other side of kitchen to bring vanilla extract and then BOOOMM, it's burst like a balloon!!!! All the drink splashed all over the kitchen from three big hols inside the glass!!! This blender should be strong enough for hard ice cubes, but with just some spoons of cold ice cream is explode!! I am so lucky, that I was in the other side of the kitchen, otherwise it might be hurts me!! I have tried to call the Ninja costumer service and ask them about, but I had to stay very long on the phone, which means I have up, as long as nothing happened with me.

01/11/2020,United States,4,MrSalsa,You can't add ingredients while the blender is running!,"I just bought the Ninja Professional Blender BL621.This is an excellent, powerful blender, and I would recommend it for anyone who blends drinks that do not require you to add ingredients while the blender is running. Unlike most other blenders, there is no opening in the lid to facilitate that. This is the only negative, and it is why this blender will not work for me. I make protein drinks and I like to add protein powder and liquid lecithin while the blender is on, so it doesn't cake and stick to the blender walls, and so the oil disperses evenly (which will not happen if you add oil before you start the blender). With the Ninja, I had to put everything in before starting the blender, and the powder clumped and stuck to the blender walls. I tried a second time, attempting to pour the powder in the little pour spout, which pops open. That spout is too small and some of the powder ended up on the counter, plus with that spout open, the mixture splattered out and up and got all over the cabinets above the blender. Thus, you can't even attempt to add ingredients through the pour spout because of major splattering; keep that spout closed while running.

01/10/2020,United States,5,Monica L.,"Not as loud as they say, Great blender.","The machines really isn't much louder than any other blender that actually has power. The blades are VERY sharp and cut the skin easily, I found this out cleaning it the first time, the manual suggests using a bristle brush to clean the blade. Blade also comes out of the pitcher which makes for easier cleaning. Lid locks and machines wont start until everything is lined up and secure. Personal smoothie option works great, but does not have a level or time button- just a pulse option that you have to hold down. Even made hummus and it turned out very smooth and creamy with good blending of flavors.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG3WJRYBW32VB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,1,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

This new Ninja just doesn't blend everything quite as well: apples get blended down to tiny pieces, but not completely, same with peanut butter. There are still tiny chunks so you're not getting a well blended smoothie. Not sure why this is happening as the power is the same. This new one is lighter generally (the blades and the base/motor) and is definitely quieter than the Ultima, but as an overall experience, the Ultima was superior for sure.

12/09/2019,United States,1,Keith Paris,Not the same high quality as my previous Ninja Pro - updated Dec21,"This is the BL660 model - Base unit quit working after a dozen uses - Ninja is sending a replacement but I have to pay for shipping and taxes. I purchased this to replace my older model that started leaking and was difficult to fix. I thought I would buy a new unit for just $15 more that purchasing a replacement pitcher and parts. I like certain features such as the quietness of the new unit, but I now have to use the spindle in the new one where the older one had a blade fixed in the pitcher. The plastic on the new unit is not the same quality, and the dishwasher safe parts are top-rack safe only unlike the older model. I also use to process hot vegetables that I cooked first prior to blending, but the new unit is rated for that.One last comment which is about the delivery, USPS delivered to my door, left the box on the front stoop in the rain and the box was soaked by the time I discovered it at 10am. UPS always bagged items that were left in the rain, USPS does not bag them, knock on the door during delivery, or any such courtesy. The USPS web site even showed it as not out for delivery when I check gthe site at 7am, but supposedly it went on the truck at 7:10am and was delivered at 7:38am in the rain. I was home the entire time, and never heard the truck arrive.

12/07/2019,United States,5,PJ,I’m so in love,"I’m so in love with this! I had the old school Ninja (the one where you put the motor on the top) for well over 10 years, so I knew that I wanted another Ninja when it was time to purchase a new one. I knew I wanted a blender that had the different levels of blades, because I hate when the stuff at the top doesn’t get blended and you have to keep stopping and stirring. So that is why I chose this one. What I wasn’t expecting was how cool these smoothie cups are! My smoothies are so creamy and well blended. Clean up is easy and I love that I can drink out of the same cup it’s blended in!Tip: fill your smoothie cup at night and freeze,.......example,.....put in the spinach, strawberries, bananas, grapes ,...at night and freeze it. Then in the morning, just pour in some coconut water or orange juice and blend it. No ice needed. The flavor is so intense when you don’t add ice.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JLOLKSYO2GVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,14,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,
12/06/2019,United States,3,Maria Dambrosio,sending it back,"I had a couple major hangups with this blender. On the pro side, it had a plenty powerful motor and the 72 oz pitcher could hold anything I had any interest in blending. However, where the 16oz cups were fine for my standard protein shakes that are based with 8oz water, they were useless for my husband's fresh fruit based smoothies. If you think you're going to use anything more than half a banana, 2 strawberries and half a dozen blueberries with all the usual smoothie things (yogurt, ice, water/milk/protein powder) think again. It didn't even come close to fitting in the 16oz cups. So I see Ninja makes 24oz and 32oz cups. Except they are not compatible with this blender...you have to have the AutoIQ variety blenders for those puppies. So return initiated.My last gripe is literally, the box. Not to be fussy, but if you are going to create packaging that is exact fit, you need to label the compartments how they fit together. I applaud the effort to minimalize packaging, but prepping it for the return felt like I was putting together a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle. Make it easy for us, please. Or, buyer beware, as you take things out of the package, take an extra moment as you unpack and do what Ninja didn't do for us...label the box slots.And do note, the stack blade of the pitcher is a pain in the neck to clean. I won't call it a total con but blech...If you want a blender that can whip up a pitcher of margaritas, this is great. But if you are a daily smoothie/shake like us, the 16oz cups are too small and the 72oz pitcher is too big. It wasn't the worst appliance I ever bought but was disappointed that it was that dysfunctional for our daily needs.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38OFUJC5REKFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,3,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

12/02/2019,United States,3,Wyomi,Doesn't work well for what I want,"I was excited to receive this and start making my daily smoothies, however I am not happy with it. I thought the multilevel blades feature would make the blending process better, however it does not have the power to vertically move the contents and get a good mix.The tower of blades is easily removable, which is good and bad. If you want to make multiple batches you do need to be careful to not have the blades fall out. With the blades removed, it is a slightly easier to squeegee the contents out, however it is very difficult to get the product off of the very sharp blades so you are still wasting product.The lid has a tight locking seal which means no ability to vent it or to add things during the blending process like a traditional blender. It is also a pain to remove the lid when adding to the blender.It is quieter than my last two blenders - one was a ninja.I believe that I will return this as I am very unhappy with the product.

11/16/2019,United States,1,NortheastGal,Terrible customer service from Ninja on an appliance that's NOT made to last,"I really, really liked this blender - at first. It seemed quite powerful and blended well, although it was very loud. I even considered wearing ear muffs when using it.But after 6 months of owning it, using it a few times per week mostly to make shakes, the lid refused to come off of the blender jar.Previously, I would depress the RELEASE button, which would move the locking tabs into the unit and allow you to lift the handle up and lift the top off. Now, no matter how hard I pressed, the handle wouldn't release at all.It seems that this is a known problem with these blenders, since I found videos on YouTube explaining how to remove the cover.Once I got the cover off, I took it apart expecting to find food debris clogging up the mechanisms inside. However, there was NO food debris inside at all.I called Ninja, since the blender was still under the 1-year warranty. The woman I spoke with offered me a new jar with a cover for half of the usual $64 price. I mentioned that my blender was still under warranty, but she said the warranty covered the motor, and not normal wear and tear. Huh???? How is a defective lid normal wear and tear?I just wanted a new lid, but she wouldn't budge. I spent $100 on this blender 6 months ago, and now it won't work.So, I have a $100 paperweight now.

Yes, it’s noisy, but it doesn’t bother me. I use the 16 ounce cups since it’s just me. I am able to add a couple more ingredients than my other single serve blender could handle, so that is great! Cleans up pretty good, but you do have to make sure the blades get clean. I noticed my ground flaxseed likes to cling to the blades, so I have to be mindful when cleaning. Speaking of which-it’s been my experience with this model that if you use any powders in your smoothies (ground flaxseed, collagen, matcha, etc), you should put those in last if you’re using the 16 ounce cup to blend in, otherwise, they will stick to the bottom and not get blended. Overall, I’m 100% satisfied!EDIT***I'll feign ignorance on this issue-depending on how often you use the blender or the cups, you need to take the gasket out either after each use or at least once or twice a week. I did not and wow, what a smell! The original gasket still works, but an odor (from my fruit smoothies) has permeated it. It's not pleasant, and there were times when I thought I had cleaned good around the blade and the cup then put the blade back on the cup only to come in the next day and have an very overpowering...stench.

I've been blending in the 16oz cups as I don't need to make anything more, but I can say that the pitcher is also amazing having worked with a previous 1000 watt model.As for cleaning, you may need to be a bit thorough with the blade attachment for the 16oz cup (cleaning the blades carefully and the inside part that screws in the cup). Can be a bit difficult to clean, especially with big hands, but not to horrible.For noise, I will say it makes quite the racket, but if you put something to separate it from the surface you're using, it will at least cut down on the vibrational noise (if you have neighbors). Just be careful not to completely block the bottom ventilated part.

The blending solution uses staggered blades, which creates a more even blend. There are only three issues I have with it:1) It is the loudest blender I've ever used (lucky it's so quick. 2-3 second full blends).2) The personal cup lids have to be screwed on tight or they'll leak.3) It's easy to cross-thread the single serving blades with the single serving cups and they're extremely hard to separate if you do that (One time I had to use a rubber mallet to get the threads lined up to unscrew them).Overall: I HIGHLY recommend this blender.

Perfect Purchase!,"You all know how it is-- you read all the reviews, you go to different websites and then you finally decide THIS is going to be the one I'll buy... And I need to say I am THRILLED. I'm used to a little wimpy 300 horsepower motor so I'm feeling like Tim the Toolman with this one. It has such remarkable strength and speed and I personally think the sound level is okay. Of course if you are doing ice or larger nuts that initial chopping adds to the motor sound, but (without having any way to measure the decibels) I didn't feel like I should be wearing earplugs.And I also like the 16 oz cups that come with it. So far they are relatively stable, and I say relatively meaning they're a little bit taller and slim at the base, and for me it's easy to knock over-- but I haven't done that so far. But like the cup lip, it is comfortable to drink from.I happen to also like the feature that after you put the cup in place and turn-lock it on the blender (or pitcher) you first press the power button on, then make your selection. I like to that there's a single serving button so there's no guessing which blend do you want to do.The user manual is particularly slight but very succinct.and I have to say I only use the big pictcher once, and I love the way it clamp shut. and I'm a woman who follows directions so I only went up to the fill line never had any leaks or anything squirting out.

I’ve been trying to return it since I purchased it but my amazon app won’t allow me to... Primarily got it to blend shakes, and wasn’t really interested in the cups.But onto the cups! I started using these since the blender is so terrible and they work great! Blades are still dull! Always have to stop and clean the blades because material is stuck to the cutting edge which prevents the blades from blending.

06/08/2019,United States,5,ChicoMike,How to operate this blender,I received this a few days ago. I came well packaged. I tried with the single serve small part of the blender but could not figure how to get it to run. Finally after reading the instruction for umpteenth time I found that the numbered levels have nothing to do with the smaller part. JUST HOLD DOWN THE BUTTON ABOVE THE NUMBERS WHICH READS SINGLE SERVE. I checked it all out. All parts work fine. The single serve really purees very well. If you need to pulse just stop the blender then touch and release the single server button on and off repeatedly for a pulse actions. Very good blender.

IF you put liquids (of course you'll put liquids) in the individual juice cups - you have to then screw a blender top on the cup and TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN.... that's how it's designed to be used. It leaks every time. You lose your juice, you make a mess, you have to clean the blender, you say bad words. This machine cost 4 times what a traditional Hamilton Beach blender costs at Target.

The main blender crushes ice beautifully and quickly. I use it when the recipes are larger or if I need to make two or more of the same flavor. I like that the lid has a pouring spout. I used it to make my favorite salad dressing & it’s not the best for simple blending. I’m glad I kept my old blender for simple blending. The blades in the big blender are SHARP. I cut myself trying to clean them the first time. So, be very careful & do not let your youngsters try to clean it - it’s a monster, but that’s why it works through ice so well.

I do have one complaint, though: as I was mixing I noticed that the stuff at the top was not getting blended. The smoothie in the bottom 2/3 of the pitcher behaved as I hoped it would, but the top 1/3 of the smoothie just went around in circles there at the top and didn't really get mixed. I guess it's possible that I overfilled it (hard to be sure when you're filling it with big chunks of stuff), but if I overfilled it, it was just slightly. Not enough to explain the top 1/3 not getting mixed. Wouldn't be a problem if I had a tamper stick, but this blender doesn't come with one and would be impossible to use with one. This may sound like a major complaint but really, it's only to be expected. I have never met a blender that doesn't do this (maybe some of the really high end ones don't; I wouldn't know).

11/21/2018,United States,3,Jennifer C.,A little disappointed,"I recently purchased this and have to say I am a bit disappointed. The single serving use works much better than making a larger quantity in the pitcher. When using the pitcher I could not get all of my ice crushed up and I was even starting with crushed ice from my fridge. Also, the higher up you went with the ingredients, the more would get stuck to the blades.

As far as working well, it's been a great blender. I don't use the blender part of it very often, but I've never had a problem with things that I've used it for. The little cups I use every day on smoothies. Do not like the blender part for smoothies, I think the cups blend a lot better. However, I did not know that the blade on the little cups, has an o-ring in the bottom of it, that needs to be removed and cleaned every time you use it. I used mine for years and did not know this, until I discovered it got moldy in there. Of course I had to throw the little o-ring away, then I couldn't find a replacement for it unless I bought a knock-off brand, which I did. That was earlier this year, the blade mechanism on the cups now seems to be shearing already and it leaks all over the place. So now I'm out to find a new blender, almost bought this one again, but the thought of having to remove the o'ring, which is not easy, has detered me from buying it again.

10/16/2018,United States,4,Michael Pace,Great mid-level blender,"This blender does a solid job of blending, and average job of food processing, and all around does a great job of a being a great blender. This is no Vitamix such as the one my family uses, but after suffering the use of a very cheap blender for years I finally decided to get one that could make blending at least bearable. This blender does an excellent job with difficult mixtures and can tackle just about any job I throw at it. It can be slightly loud but that is to be expected from a blender. I liked this particular style due to the simplicity of use in that it only has 5 blend options. This makes morning routines very streamlined. The single-serve option is in-fact my most used option as it is very effective in speed and consistency management. The large bin is not as good at consistency management but the tower blade helps to compensate for this.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19R7SK2JV5UNF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,0,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,
10/16/2018,United States,2,Crystal,Single serve blender piece is not up to par!,"I use this product mostly with the single serve blender shakes and unfortunately have not been satisfied. The reason is that when I add ice and fruit, usually a frozen half banana it seems the unit is not powerful enough to blend it. This happened right away when I started using it. It does blend it but it jerks the cup to point of almost jerking it loose from unit. That does not seem normal. I contacted SharkNinja and the first time they sent me a whole new unit, every piece brand new. It still continued to happen so I called again and also explained that this time it jerked so hard it popped a rubber piece loose on the single blade piece. They sent a replacement single serve blender piece....and now with this one it still continues to do the same thing! When I talked to them before they sent me the last replacement I asked if there was a way that I could upgrade to their larger unit (thinking more wattage is what it needs to blend ice and banana) and pay the difference, and they said I wasn’t able to do that. I got this as a gift in Dec. 2017 and now I’m just stuck with it. Unhappy customer unfortunately. I will say that we make salsa with the big blender piece and have had success with that part but I mainly use it for the single serve shake cup part.",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R390LUNGZJ0UX1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,0,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

So after looking for one that didn’t cost a huge chunk of cash I decided to get this Ninja blender. I’m so glad I did! I’ve had it for just over a week and I’ve used it every day. It’s perfect for what I need it for-smoothies and shakes. I LOVE the 2single serving cups and lids. They are perfect for making my husband a smoothie before work. And one for me for my breakfast.

This time they had no further suggestions for preventing the mold and wanted me to pay for a new single serve top plus shipping and handling. I do not want to purchase another top when based on my experience it will develop a mold issue. I called hoping that the company had come up with a solution for the successful cleaning of their product. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I believe that this product has a poor design and is not worth the cost.

07/26/2018,United States,2,Randy,Problem with spout cover on lid. Customer service not very helpful.,"The ninja works well at blending from my experience but there are some quality and customer service concerns.There is a small clear plastic cover that goes over the pour spout of the LID. This item is known to break off but there is no replacement available anywhere.I contacted Ninja customer service and they told me that I would have to purchase an entirely new pitcher/lid combo. Customer service did offer me a 10% off coupon but even after applying it the price comes out to over $70 after tax/shipping.So due to a defective piece of plastic that is guaranteed to break, I have to spend $70 each time? Might be cheaper up front for a Ninja than a vitamin mixer or blending technicians but if you have to spend $70 each time a cheap piece of plastic breaks then costs will catch up/surpass pretty quickly.I was able to find just a lid by itself on Amazon/Ebay for about $40, but this is still too expensive just to address a part that will inevitably break.I can't justify the price of the pitcher/lid or just the lid itself so I'm just covering the opening with my hand when I'm using the blender.

06/21/2018,United States,5,Stack⠀Overflow,I love the triple layer of blade design because they help ...,"This worked very well for me. I love the triple layer of blade design because they help to get to stuff sitting on top of the carafe. On regular blenders with bottom-only blades, you have to ensure you have enough liquid to enable the blades on the bottom to draw the contents on top to the bottom where the blades can get to them. With the triple layer blade design, the blades get to the contents in the middle and top even when your liquid levels are low.------------------------------------------------------------IMPORTANT NOTE ON THE BLADES------------------------------------------------------------There are TWO SETS of blades (one for the carafe and one for the mugs). The blades are EXTREMELY SHARP!!!!! I got cut while I was unpacking this unit. BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE UNPACKING/HANDLING THIS UNIT.I've never had the very reputable Vitamix and Blendtec blenders, both of which cost 5 times as much as this Ninja, so I can't compare the Ninja to these. But from hearsay, the Vitamix and Blendtec do blend contents into finer bits. For those into liquid nutrition, this might be a big deal, because the finer blending is supposed to release more of the nutrients. Personally, I'm skeptical of this supposition. I need a blender mainly for smoothies and for this purpose, the Ninja does a fine job. No unblended bits or chunks in my smoothie, like a smoothie should be -- smooth!The caveat to this post is this my opinion is from < 1 week of use, so I can't speak to the durability of this product. Another caveat is I've only done fruit smoothies on this; I don't know how it performs on crushing ice. Additionally, there have been a sizable number of reports that the carafe and mugs crack either inexplicably (doubtful) or in the dishwasher (more likely). Worst comes to worst, you can buy replacement carafe or mugs, although they're not cheap (around 30.00 - 40.00 for the carafe, I think).I don't think I've read any reports of the motor breaking. This is very good news!If anything were to break, this has a 1 year warranty. (FYI: Vitamix and Blendtec have warranties of 10 and 7 years (!), respectively.)---Overall, I think this unit is a good bet if you're strapped for cash and need a reasonably priced and decent blender. If money is not an object, I'd recommend the extremely reputable Vitamix.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XG0ZE1NPCV1D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,1,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

Anyway if you are thinking of buying the Ninja go for it you won’t be disappointed. I’m giving it 4 stars because of the way it was delivered and because of the chord but other than that I’m very happy with it.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gio1xytEL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71z-UaafK4L._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ojOVedPUL._SY1600.jpg",,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REKRUJ7WA0V0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,154,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

04/26/2018,United States,5,D. Aks,"Great value, perfect for shakes and smoothies. BE CAREFUL OF BLADES!!!!","I haven't had a blender in many years. About six months ago I started a new health and exercise regimen...determined to feel and looking better by making small steps every day. I eat a lot of fresh fruit and veggies like avocado, kale, bananas, etc. I decided a couple months ago that it was time for the next step...healthy, clean smoothies! I was a little lost on where to start, and trying to figure out if I wanted to splurge the extra couple hundred dollars for a Vitamix or if a Ninja would do the trick.I am glad I saved the money and went with the Ninja. Although I'm sure if you use the blender for a lot more than smoothies and for really rough food items a Vitamix could be a great investment - but for smoothies? This is perfect for me and I don't possibly see how they could taste better. I love how this comes with two cups so that you can make single-serve smoothies without all of the huge mess of using the big blender. I mostly only use this for single-serve smoothies, so I haven't touched the big one in a long time.WARNING - please be warned that the blades are EXTREMELY sharp, and I do believe that Ninja should alert you to this more while opening. While opening the package, my husband literally sliced his finger open. He hates going to the hospital so stitched it himself...but it was serious, probably about 6 stitches worth. It was a massive gash and the packaging doesn't warn you about it at all. I read another reviewer said that when her husband opened it the blade was loose and literally fell on his food and he had huge lacerations and had to go to the ER. So it's nothing to mess with. I was actually kind of terrified of the blender for a short while after it happened, but it's fine now...just be careful!The SINGLE-SERVE is really the life-saving part of this. Here is my absolute favorite smoothie recipe:Banana Peanut Butter Yogurt Smoothie1/4 cup water3-4 ice cubes1 banana3/4 cup of yogurt (I prefer the new Oui French Yogurt by Yoplait. One glass container is exactly 3/4 cups).Pinch of cinnamon1 tablespoon organic peanut butterOptional: ice cream (if I'm in the mood) or a half a scoop or scoop of protein powder after a particularly hard workout. Make sure when you make smoothies to put THE SOFT STUFF on TOP! I used to put the ice last on the top and it takes like 10 times as long to blend. Sounds really obvious, but I totally was not thinking at first. In about 30 seconds or less your smoothie is absolutely perfect. I have zero problems with it. It's totally smooth, delicious, and the cups are really easy to clean and I love the lids.I am so happy with this purchase. If you are a gourmet chef and are blending things constantly for dinners a Vitamix may be for you...but for basic things, like smoothies or shakes? This is perfect and I'm so glad I chose this one.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G9696BVEZZNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,24,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

One downside is you can't really make chunky salsa since it turns everything into liquid (even apples) on the lowest setting (I actually love this, though). It's easy to clean and holds up well.

04/18/2018,United States,2,Kristeenie,"Painfully loud, mediocre at blending.","We just returned this blender because it was seriously the loudest blender I have ever encountered, and it didn't even do a very good job blending. It's loud because it has a dual-speed spindle to accommodate both the large jug and the to-go cups, so there's some sort of gearbox inside, rather than most blenders that are just direct drive. Even with absolutely nothing in the blender, it is loud enough to wake up the kids on the second floor, and make your ears ring after turning it off. I suspect it would give you permanent hearing loss if you used it every day.On top of this, the smoothies are not very smooth at all.

02/26/2018,United States,1,Huapango,Be aware of low quality and very expensive replacement parts.,"I got a Ninja blender about two years ago because of all these good reviews but I was really dissapointed. To begin with, I didn’t liked the fact that it is hard to clean and puting the lid on and off is a pain in the butt. However I got used to it and dealt with the cleaning part. Then about a month after the warranty expired the plastic pitcher cracked so I had to replaced the part which cost me $84 including shipment. It was expensive for a plastic pitcher but still cheaper than buying a new blender since I already had the motor. So, spending another $125 didn’t make much sense... until today. This morning the second pitcher cracked while I was making a banana milk shake! Seriously? It is not that I’m crushing rocks in it! I hadn’t even put the ice in it! so really there’s no reason for it to have cracked other than regular use. Why am I keeping this blender? I think I just didn’t want to accept I made a mistake by purchasing something that looks good in my kitchen but it is not durable enough and doesn’t give me the service I need from a good blender. I learned my lesson the hard way. No more Ninja products for me, no matter how cool the name sounds.",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SUCQI54ZEU8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,1,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

02/23/2018,United States,1,Carolyn Macky,Made from cheap materials.,"Although I've had this blender for about 4 years, I haven't used it a lot. I use the large blender once a year at Thanksgiving, but I like having the individual drink mixers to make smoothies and mixed drinks. Now the blender won't work with the individual drink containers. Everything looks normal, but when I put the container in the blender and turn on the power, the power button just flashes and nothing moves or makes a sound. The large blender container still works, but I don't want to have to use that every time I want to make a smoothie. Also, the lid on the large container has always been difficult to get off and on. If you don't handle it just right, it comes apart. The little tabs that hold the lid on the container are very fragile, made of cheap plastic that looks like it will break. I've been very disappointed with this blender; for something that had such a high rating, I thought it should last longer, especially since I haven't used it much.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJPVXJDIRMQO9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,2,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

I mean heck if I knew it only has like 4 modes, I'd just thrown in the extra $20 and bought a model with more functions.Oh and, the cups do not have a seal. Like, seriously, nobody thought, Hey, maybe they would like to just store these cups in the fridge for once?. THERE IS A HOLE IN THE DAMN CUP. It is literally a cup to go, as in, you have to drink it right after you blend it, because there is no way to seal the contents inside. Oh and good luck trying to find a different type of seal to replace the one it comes with, because there are none for that specific cup size.Oh but wait! Other models offer bigger cups that also have a seal! Why not use those? WELL YOU CAN'T. Because the cups for this model are specific to just this model.

I premix it the night before and put in the fridge. It is still perfectly mixed in the morning when I wake up. Problem solved. The lid locks in place (pitcher) - very important safety feature. The two cups that come with it are great for single serve.

01/29/2018,United States,3,The Wild one,Vita Prep vs Ninja Pro: Raw Fruit & Veggie Smoothie Comparison,I had a Vita Prep that recently broke (my fault) & decided to buy a Ninja since the reviews were so great. I don't use my blender for making soups or milling flour or making butters or anything fancy. I use my blender on a daily basis to make a smoothie that consists of various raw berries & raw veggies. I can tell you I was excited to not have to use a tamper anymore but was underwhelmed by the results. It does not blend the blackberry & raspberry seeds very well nor does it blend raw broccoli very well (the little nubs on the florets are practically left whole even though I allow it to blend on high for a longer time than I did on my Vita Prep). My smoothie just doesn't come out very smooth with the Ninja & I have to chew my smoothie before I can swallow it. I'd say the Ninja works better as a food processor rather than a blender because the results are fairly lumpy & not smooth. I will be returning Ninja Pro & giving the Ninja Chef a try next. I hope that one produces smoother results as I really don't want to spend $300 or more on a blender just so that I can get a decent smoothie.,,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PNIT1Y3IAS1V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,2,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

I am using it to make liposomal vitamin C, which is a viscous fluid (it has oil in it). The blender throws the liquid against the top so forcefully (it has a powerful motor), that it pushes it against the spout cover, where it comes dribbling out and runs down the side of the blender, where I have to clean it. I am only mixing less than 1000 ml of liquid--and it gets less due to leakage every time I blend it , which is six times in a day. Even when I push down hard on the spout cover it comes out. I don't know yet if this happens with all liquids, as I've only used it for the liposomal C so far.I'm going to eventually find a workaround, but I shouldn't have to, thus--three stars.Also (this is not a flaw), be CAREFUL.

Has two separate cups to use for traveling. I don’t really use the big huge one since I only blend in the house. So I use the personal cup one and it’s so great. I don’t have to worry about making too much and wasting food. It also isn’t super loud. I can also easily chop ice. I had the hardest time with my last blender because I’d have to stop and clear the blades and the ice would just melt in that time lol (so annoying) but the Ninja does it effortlessly.

It disassembles easily which is great for when it comes time to clean it. Just be careful, those blades are SHARP!The one thing I am not to fond of is the suction cups on the feet of the blender. Don't get me wrong, they do a great job keeping the unit in place. I just don't see the need for them and they are kind of a pita to remove from a countertop.

It’s big, so u can make a lot at once. I make like 3 smoothies at a time and I love it. I could prob make like 4 or 5 if I wanted. The blades are very sharp so be careful. My friend cut them selves on it when they were putting it together 😑 I like how it comes with the two little cups and little blade to make personal drinks, although I never use that part, it’s a nice added feature. It’s a little loud blending frozen fruit, but that’s expected and it’s not as loud as other cheap blenders I’ve had in the past. The only thing I don’t like about it are the suction cups on the bottom base. I have an extremely tiny kitchen and the only spot I can fit it in is under my cabinets. My cabinets are so low tho that it almost touches the lid of the blender, so when I need to move it out to take the lid off the suction cups won’t let it move and it’s just annoying for me lol.

I love to make coconut milk in mine on a regular basis. I was hesitant to get the Nutri Ninja cups but my husband insisted and he was right; I love the ease of making a single smoothie or grinding a small amount of an ingredient for cooking (I used mine to make garlic ginger paste in a snap for an Indian dish the other day).

11/01/2017,United States,2,Ana,"Disappointed - warps, leaks, and burns me when I make bulletproof coffee","I decided to splurge when I moved into a new place and by a new blender as my old bullet blender had stopped working. With that one I had mostly made smoothies, occasionally tomato sauces, and had recently gotten into making bulletproof coffee, and had never had any issues until it stopped working, after many years of use. At first I was pretty happy with this blender set, although one thing I didn't understand or care for at all were the suction cups on the base of the blender - I like to move things around in my kitchen, and it's annoying having this one appliance that is constantly stuck to the kitchen counter, especially considering the issues I've had with it. SO the issues: Lately when I've been making my bullet proof coffee, I started noticing that more and more frequently, the smaller size container would start leaking, either before I put it on the base or afterwards. So obviously this was annoying, spilling coffee all over the counter and the base, and I started trying to be more careful, checking the connection to make sure the lid was securely fastened. But I STILL kept having issues, and this reached a BOILING point the other day when I went to take the thing off the base after blending, and it unscrewed itself on the base and hot coffee came squirting up into the air, burning both of my hands and arms, and needless to say, getting all over the counter, fridge, fridge, floor, and blender base. I was pissed. Then I noticed that the blender components seem to have become warped, I assume from the heat, and that's why I have been having issues. Now I looked through the reviews and I see people saying things about how this isn't meant for heat, but I don't remember that being made clear when I bought the dang thing. I just assumed if I was paying like $75 for a blender it would be able to blend hot or cold food like every other blender I have used in my life.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BQXED05P95RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,14,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

This design also means that a mess is made every time; the bulky blade piece drips EVERYWHERE, and it has to be taken out/put back in to stir and taste. Cleaning the blades is also cumbersome. I was also not impressed with how this blade design handles chia seeds. I thought my mom's Oster from the 70's that she donated to me did a better job of this (RIP old school blender). This unit is HUGE. Also, the plastic container seems a bit flimsy (I prefer glass, but didn't think to check before buying this).

We bought this blender and immediately noticed that it had four spiral cracks starting from the bottom of the pitcher where manufacturer made hole is that the blade attaches to (*see photos attached to this review). After many long waits on hold with the company, I was finally able to get a replacement that took about a month to arrive. Their customer service representatives were very rude and were accusing me of having done something to crack the blender pitcher; however, a quick google search will reveal that there are many people experiencing these same uniform spiral cracks on the bottoms of their Ninja blender pitchers. Then, my replacement pitcher had the same exact cracks that began to spread from the bottom of the pitcher. Again, I called them for a replacement and was treated poorly. They said my one-year warranty was up. I argued that I did not have the replacement pitcher for a year, and that they replaced my cracked pitcher with another cracked pitcher and should therefore provide me with a pitcher that is not broken. It is obviously a factory defective, faulty item. This blender is of low quality and not built to last.

08/25/2017,United States,5,Shelton_50,An honest review on the Ninja Pro from a die hard Foodie.,"I didn't want to review this as soon as I got it because I wanted to give my best opinion on the product. That is this thing is amazing! I have basically lived off gazpacho since I bought it. I've made amazing pie crusts in it, and I now make smoothies almost daily. I really like this blender. I have made pie crusts in a food processor before to save time but never a blender. I thought the only way it would be possible to make a pie crust in a blender would be with a Vitamix and that's just not true. This Ninja pro blender works just as well on a budget. So if you want that Vitamix but don't see that large price in your budget, go with the Ninja.I will say that although I don't mind, I am not impressed with the plastic containers. It's not something to complain about. I'm just not impressed. I would imagine that having plastic containers means they don't last as long as other glass blenders. I don't wash this in the dishwasher because it said not too in the package. So my plastic pieces still all look new, even after daily use over months.One warning, I'd like to put out there about this blender is, the main blade(not the nutri blade) is so sharp you should be very careful washing it by hand. I believe one of the reasons this blender works so well is that it has extremely sharp blades. But you need to be careful cleaning them. I have cut my fingers and so has my husband. Its so sharp that those cuts look like paper cuts. But in my opinion that's a good thing for blenders because it helps them work well.In short, the Ninja Pro is plastic, not dishwasher safe, and the blades are CRAZY sharp! BUT! It works very well and the savings over similar products makes it well worth the price.

I was using a small single serving blender before and the process would take at least 30 min, now it takes 10 min with prep and cleanup included!

08/03/2017,United States,4,LastDays,Great sort of bulky blender,"I got this blender to make smoothies. I was using a cheap 30 or so dollar blender for years and it was always a strugle to get that thing blending since it always made air pockets and you'd have to stir the contents and try again. After using my mother's vitamix I decided I needed a new blender. But I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for it.I saw the ninja on sale and swooped on it, my days watching the 3 ninjas and karate kid as a child had finally paid off as I was able to subdue this guy with no problem.THE BLENDER: I was a little dissapointed at first with how bulky it is, the three blades and the clunky lid are kind of awkward at first. But I am satisfied with the performance. Can't expect the performance of a machine 4 times it's price, right? I mostly use the pitcher to make my smoothies because I like to make bigger 28oz smoothies for my breakfast. But the single serve works fine.One thing I've noticed when looking through reviews is complaints of the pitcher cracking and lid warping. All I have to say is stop being lazy and wash your ninja by hand.

There is a small warning stuck on top of the lid that states the blades are sharp and loose, and liquid should only be poured through the spout with the lid on. We made smoothies yesterday and removed the lid to check the consistency and add milk. When we were happy, we poured several cups. My son poured the last cup, and as he tilted the blender, the blade assembly slid out and fell to the floor.My daughter, who was standing next to him, suffered a deep laceration to her foot after the blade assembly hit her on it's way down.She has an one inch laceration that required 5 stitches at the ER. The cut was very deep, the blade almost went through the foot.I feel we were very lucky that she did not suffer a more serious laceration. Given her standing position, the weight, sharpness and fall trajectory of the blade assembly, the injury could have been much worse. It's not an exaggeration to say she could easily have suffered a laceration to her arm or leg resulting in damage to the radial or femoral artery.It's hard to believe there isn't some form of friction or locking mechanism to stop the blade assembly slipping out as easily as it does.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CXOU95508DP9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,21,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

So I will probably avoid using that and continue to do the individual smoothies instead. I have had some trouble getting the blade piece to easily screw onto the cup. The threads don't seem to match well. One time I screwed the blade into the cup and turned it on; it leaked all over the place. I also find the suction cups on the bottom very annoying.

I am not currently including berries in my diet, so I may never find out the answer to the question.

05/01/2017,United States,1,Fabgabulous7,Horrible design - leads to leaks and aggravation,"I have to say I'm disappointed. Using the full size attachment doesn't work as well as I expected. The food tends to stick to the side and the blades don't reach. It never does a great job of truly blending chia or flax seed or fresh greens in smoothies which is what I was hoping for. Smoothies never turn out truly smooth. The biggest issue though is with the smaller single serving attachment. I use this literally every day for my bulletproof coffee in the morning. The way the cup/blade is designed it is very easy to twist the blade attachment on slightly crooked which results in either 1) the green button to blend won't go on, or 2) it leaks and creates a huge mess as soon as you turn it upside down because there isn't a good seal. It's a horrible design. Again, I use this every morning and 80% of the time I have to rescrew the blade on at least 3 or 4 times before I can get it to work with a good seal. It's a pain in the neck but I spent so much money on this blender and can't invest in a new one right now so I'm stuck with it.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGT1UU65366U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,3,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

This is the first one that had the motor go out. In the past, I've given away blenders when I wanted to buy a new one because they never stop working. This is the most expensive blender I've ever bought. It's also the poorest quality to break down so quickly. I was told that I could buy anew motor base for $100. I see no reason to do so.

04/24/2017,United States,2,arriazac,The single serve containers are too small!,"I bought this item at Best Buy using the price match with Amazon. I was shocked of how small the single serve containers are. I thought it was the same size as the one that came with the first ninja bullet (have the comparison on the photos). I don't plan on using the blender one as much as the single serve options due to only having my husband who drinks kale smoothies every other day but I thought having the mistaken thought of the old single serve containers and a big blender for $100 and higher watts for the same price as when he bought the first version of the ninja 4 years ago, I was like let me get this instead when we have visitors and need to make a lot of smoothies. To my disappointment of how small the single serve containers are, i was just shocked. They should have at least made the single serve containers 20oz instead of 16oz or better yet kept the same size as the first ninja bullet containers. Those were perfect for single serve kale smoothies(small) or 2 servings of smoothies (taller) haven't tried the 72oz, like I said it'll be used when I have visitors or when I make my Jamba Juice imitation smoothie. I'm glad the 72oz is also a food processor, I can make basil pesto now. I haven't used it but hopefully the blades will be ok and will not rust or anything. The older version of the single serve ninja we had bought 4 years ago started melting metal in which we realized was going inside our smoothies(it's when black junk and copper looking shavings are showing under the attachable blade. Therefore we decided to get another one. The problem I have with this for single serving, it's great that you do not need to push down anymore but you have to press the single serve on your own.

Upon opening it, I discovered the manufacturers were ingenious. All the packing was cardboard, completely recyclable, in origami like folds, could be folded out flat! This was probably more exciting to me than the blender itself.The blender is huge. It doesn't fit under any of my cupboards. It also has suction cups on the bottom, which, in operation, are a good thing, but during the time you are not using the thing, is a real pain in the butt because it sticks to the surface and is hard to move and impossible to slide.Ok, I've finally used it. One, to grind sprouted grains, and then also to make smoothies. It works great! and surprise, I have found myself using one of the little extra cups, to make small shakes or grind small quantities of things. It is easy to clean, and easy to use. I really like it!

This packaging was so clever, with finger holes which made the smaller boxes easy to pull out of the large box and easy open tabs. I assembled it all in just a few minutes. Then when I used it I really loved it! The triple blade action blends very well. Although it is large it looks nice on the counter. I can blend five smoothies at once so I make them on Monday morning and refrigerate them in to-go cups for the whole week! Cleaning is easy too. The couple of issues I have had is that big chunks of frozen fruit don't fit below the top blade so they are hard to get started.

It never leaks, it makes smoothies much smoother than the Nutribullet, has a much larger capacity and costs about the same. If I want to make an individual serving I can but most of the time I like to have a couple of large glasses of a smoothie and the Nutribullet or single serving size of the Ninja is not enough. This is worth every penny of the $90 and the Nutribullet in comparison should cost about $30 because it is 1/3 as good but it is way overpriced at $90 at most stores.

I actually bought this blender for the sole reason that it had the single serve option. I have next to no time in the morning when getting ready for work so to quickly make a shake and not have to clean anything is amazing for me. However, here's the big problem. I cannot get the lid off the to go mug. I drive an hour to work and enjoy my shake. Immediately upon arriving at work I always go the rinse out my cup. Well, it's super glued on. I mean to the point that it won't budge to come off. I asked 2 strong men to try to get the lid off and they cannot. I appreciate that the to go cup is durable and won't leak on me when in transit however, it poses an even larger problem that I can't get the lid off to clean the cup.

03/01/2017,United States,4,The 2000 Man,Pitcher broke after two years.,"I purchased the Ninja Professional BL660 blender from Amazon in March, 2015. At the time I would have given it a 5-star review. It is easily the best blender I have ever owned. I use this blender about twice a week, mostly to make smoothies. It powers through ice and frozen fruit with ease. However, after a little less than two years (as of Feb., 2017) of use it has developed some problems: 1) The rubber gasket on the lid has become warped and misshapen. I suspect this is the result of being run through the dishwasher. So despite claims that it is dishwasher safe, it looks like it is not. 2) Shortly after this was purchased a piece of plastic broke off the bottom of the pitcher. It didn't seem to affect it though so I kept using it. A few days ago one of the plastic tabs that holds the closed while the blender is running broke off. Upon closer inspection it looks like cracks are developing around the other tab. A replacement pitcher and lid is available on the Ninja website and from an Amazon seller. Despite this I will buy the replacement parts and keep using this blender, but I'm not happy about it. As I mentioned it is a great blender and probably as good most blenders costing much more. I am attaching photos detailing the problems I have encountered. My advice is to always hand wash, but be really careful with the crazy sharp blades.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617p5fVxIdL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61glJ+DG4rL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61i6tP+eSqL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jO1mPiKzL._SY1600.jpg",,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QPNSO68U9JPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,105,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

02/16/2017,United States,4,Mammatus Books,Solid and powerful; with a funky blade,"I use this blender daily for green smoothies. It has sufficient power and durability to take the abuse that I've put on it for about 2 months now. The only reason I knock off one star is that the blade is an interesting configuration that makes loading the blender somewhat difficult. Rather than just one section of metal blades at the bottom of the pitcher, as is customary in blenders, this model of Ninja has a long 'tower' that runs through the center of the pitcher with a series of blades along the column. The column then rests in a small divot in the underside of the lid. One one hand, this blade does a superb job pulling all of the material in and chopping it all up beautifully without the necessity of a spoon or plunger to move material toward the blade. The down side is that loading a large quantity of spinach -- the first item I put into the pitcher for a smoothie - requires some finesse ... and some forcing to get it past the blade all along that center column. So overall, I'm pleased and I would indeed buy it again. I can't fault the design of the blade since it is superb for keeping material moving, but for the narrow purpose of leafy greens, it is somewhat of a pain.",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KAOU7XHN1KX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,3,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

We bought one for my father to replace an older blender that broke in our dishwasher. After seeing the package we decided to finally bite the bullet and get one for ourselves. This thing is a beast! It crushes anything you throw at it with ease! I worried from some reviews about the sides being plastic but that doesn't seem to be slowing this blender down. The blades are SUPER sharp, so instead of hand washing them or risking the damage in the dishwasher, we put hot, soapy water in it and let it run. It gets all those nooks and crannies we might normally miss and we don't lose fingers!I've had a magic bullet before, so I was a little weary of the single serve cups. Turns out, those blades are just as sharp, if not sharper! The downward pull helps everything blend quickly. I have not had to blend anything more than 20 seconds with the single serve cups.My only complaint about this blender is that I can't figure out how much stuff to put into the big container to make just a couple smoothies. I always end up putting too much, and now we have a bunch of containers of ice cream in the freezer.

01/19/2017,United States,2,Jupolo,"Great single serve, TERRIBLE main blender","A little torn as to whether to give it 2 stars or 3. The single serve cups are great, blends kale stems and ice cubes down to nothing in seconds for my smoothies. You can just add your food, blend and drink - no pre-blending or stopping and starting needed, cleaning the single serve cups is also a snap. Top marks for the single serve cups, if that is all you care about and the price is right for you, you will not be disappointed.Now for the main blender... what were they thinking when they designed this! We tried to blend 1-2 cubed raw squash. It completely failed (ended up scraping it into the single serve cup where it worked fine). The main blender cup is square in cross section, but the blades spin in a circle, so there are big dead zones at the corners where large chunks of food hide. Next issue, the access hole in the lid is a small pour spout, too small to put anything in while blending. The lid itself holds the blades in, so it would be a huge safety hazard to take the lid off while the blender is on, so you can't add anything mid blend. The blades are a crazy design, there are 6 big blades at 3 different heights, all very sharp. Wife cut herself on it first time cleaning it. The blades are not angled like on every other blender ever made. This means that there is no vortex - this in turn means that food is not pulled down to the bottom of the blender where the blades should be. If it works at all, food is at best shredded, not blended. This blender might work well if you are blending wet foods, but otherwise this is TERRIBLE. Big disappointment.

12/28/2016,United States,2,newbie,Definitely no Vitamix. Does not blend smoothly.,"I always saw them as a cheaper version of the more expensive high end blenders. That is, until I actually used one. I was anti-Vitamix before, mainly due to the outrageous cost, but now I understand why there is a huge difference.Pros:-The motor is much more powerful than a standard blender.-Very quick blending due to the 3 bladesCons:-Cheaply made. For example, after only a few uses, the pour cap on the lid broke and falls off all the time. Also feels very cheap.-Messy/Difficult cleaning. As soon as you start this thing, the entire container and lid get plastered with whatever is in the blender. Sure, not the end of the world, but plan to spend more time cleaning. With my Vitamix, the container tends to not get dirty much above where you filled it, plus it is very easy to clean by simply blending soap and water.-3 blade assembly. The 3 blade assembly is very annoying. It makes it much more difficult to fill the blender. Also more difficult to clean, easy to cut yourself with and good luck replacing it if it is taken out when the blender isn't empty. You really don't want to be dealing with this thing. It is a pain.-My biggest problem with this blender-- It does not blend smoothly. If you try to blend anything that is rough, it will not fully blend. I added kale to my smoothie and instead of being blended in, my drink had finely chopped kale pieces in it even after blending for a fair amount of time.

11/16/2016,United States,1,Ivan Baccarat,Bad design,"This blender is poorly designed. First off the blades are overkill. There is no need for this many blades and they take up a lot of the inside of the blender. Secondly there are a lot of little things that are tremendously annoying. Like the suction cups on the bottom, you literally can't move it, slide it, or pick it up without disengaging them, thirdly you can't blend things without the lid being attached which is a pain in the ass in itself because unless everything is aligned just right you can't even just put the lid on. And you have to twist the blender into place each time you use it. Nor can you put things in the blender while it's blending because, again, it won't start unless the lid is clicked and locked into place. Also you have to take the blade assembly out each and every time you use it and because it's so big a lot of what you've blended is coating the assembly. I like to be able to dump stuff in as I'm blending and don't want to remove the blade assembly each and every time I blend something.

It was a sweet deal for us getting a ton of free stuff. One of the items happened to be a Ninja Blender. I know, who doesn’t bother to take a blender that is a beast home with them, well guess they didn’t see any value in the maybe used twice blender. I have two of the blenders single serve cups and this thing chews through ice like you have never seen. I tried it out with ice and fruit, worked instantly to break it down and a mix. Then I tried out the big blender container with ice in it. Its makes shave ice! Awesome! We also made a huge thing of Pina coladas and they came out just like the ones at resorts in Puerto Rico.

11/16/2016,United States,2,D.A.,Height + suction cups really sucks for me,"Our old 30$ Oster blender gave out.. I really hated that blender and was excited it finally stopped working :-) It was super loud, didn't blend anything unless there was a crazy amount of liquid and even then I had to smack the side with it running to get things mixed right.Anyway I started looking for a replacement. Not impressed with this Ninja. Many reviewers said the suction cups are annoying but I ordered anyways. I put it on the on the counter under the cabinets, with the lid on and tested getting it out for use and putting back. It doesn't slide at all. In fact it so tall there isn't enough clearance to tilt and easily break the suction. I proceeded to re-box and didn't even turn it on. I re-read reviews and found recommendations to use a pot holder or paper towel under the unit.. ridiculous. If it moves that much the base should be heavier, even at this price range I feel.Like some reviewers I'm suspicious that this brand is over hyped but I returned for replacement with the Nutri Ninja Auto-iQ Compact System (BL492) unit because I really want to like the Ninja to replace a blender + magic bullet type. . If that doesn't work out I am looking at the: Oster Pro 1200 Blender Plus 24 oz Smoothie Cup.It's fine for lots of folks, especially if you have higher that standard (17?) but the height + suction was a deal killer for me",,,TRUE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T48XJR6KW39B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,4,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

11/13/2016,United States,4,The Hobyist,Ninja Professional Blender works well,"I have been using the Ninja Professional Blender for about 3 months now. It does a much better job of chopping/mixing the fruit and such in my smoothies than my older standard blender. I like that I can use the smaller glass size container with the blender attachment for just one smoothie, or the bigger pitcher with the multi blade center piece to make smoothies for my husband and kids as well. I will caution that inside the glass size container blender attachment is a rubber washer that you will need to take out to wash & dry. I didn't realize this at first, so it got dark spots - maybe mold? - on it. When I realized the washer was in there, I took it out and soaked it in a bleach water mix, then washed again with soapy water. It seems to be fine. But, I would have liked to know in advance that the washer was in there, and how to easily take it out - because it is difficult to remove.

11/13/2016,United States,5,MP,Quality Blender at a Great Price!,"Pros: Easy to use, great for on the go, blends incredibly fastCons: A little on the loud sideBottom Line: This is a great blender, especially if you are wanting to make a quick smoothie on the go.When my husband and I moved into our first apartment 14 years ago my mother-in-law brought us a blender as a house warming gift. It worked fine to make smoothies if we did not use frozen fruit, in that case we would blend...mix everything around with a wooden spoon…blend more...mix more…repeat. It would take up to five minutes to make a smoothie. We held onto that blender for 14 years, maybe because it was a gift, or maybe because of nostalgia. This year though we decided it was time for an upgrade. After quite a bit of research and asking for recommendations we decided to buy the Ninja Professional Blender (BL600). This blender has changed the way we eat and has made us wonder why we waited so long to upgrade. It is so easy and safe to use that our kids use it to make themselves smoothies. It is fast and makes single serve smoothies that are perfect when we are running late trying to get out the door to work. I recommend this blender to anyone looking to make smoothies, especially ones on the go.Blending Speed:This blender has three speeds plus one just for the single serve. It is simple and makes it easy to use. I can load the blender up with frozen fruit, almond milk, chia seeds, and spinach, and have an amazingly delicious smoothie in 30 seconds or less.Smooth Action:When reading through reviews for this blender there was some mention of it not doing a good enough job making a smooth blend, but rather leaving chunks and grains. We use this blender regularly and fill it with a lot of frozen fruit and grainy protein powder and seeds and have yet to experience this issue. All our smoothies come out perfectly smooth.Safety:From the rubber grips on the bottom that make it secure to the counter, to the safety lock on the lid that does not allow the blender to start without being secured; this blender is safe and reassuring for those with young kids wanting to help in the kitchen. I give this an A+ for safety which is high up on my importance list since our four-year-old daughter loves being involved with anything related to the kitchen and helping.Ease of Cleaning:What makes the blender so easy to clean in comparison to some of the others is that the blade has an easy to grab rubber grip above it that makes it easy to remove before cleaning. All the pieces to the machine come apart easily making cleaning quick and painless.Options:The two-single serve to-go style cups with lids was the cherry on the top for us. My husband and I both like to make smoothies in the morning, but have very different tastes. Not only do we each get to fill our own single serve cup up with our individual preferred ingredients, but we save dishes by just taking that cup to go rather than using a blender and then pouring it into to-go cups. Bonus: the single serve cups are also easy to clean.Noise Factor:The noise level on this blender is the one complaint I have. It is expected that a blender will not be silent, but this one is a little louder than I had expected. It is not a make or break deal for us, but we wait until nap time is over to make smoothies in our house.Cost:We paid $99.99 for our Ninja Professional Blender which was about mid-range in comparison to the other blenders we considered buying. We have used my mother-in-law’s Magic Bullet which she paid a little more for, but in my opinion makes about the same quality smoothie. $99.99 seems like a reasonable price for something we make so much use of.",,,FALSE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHW75F5SBZIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K,0,B00939FV8K,Style: 1100 Watts with Single Serve,

I really like the two single-serve cups for when a small batch is just fine. It's also useful to prevent cross-contamination of ingredients (think food allergies). The blender sits quite secure on our counter because of the suction cups, but they may not work on granite counters. If that's the case, you'll likely want to hold it because it vibrates enough that a full pitcher could tip over.The lid of the big pitcher only fits one way and it locks in place. There is a pop-top on the lid so you can pour out the contents without accidentally dumping the blades out on your counter.The only down side to this blender is that the pitcher is made of plastic.
